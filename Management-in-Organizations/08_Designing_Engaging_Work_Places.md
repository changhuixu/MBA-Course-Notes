# 8 Designing Engaging Work Places

One of the ways managers influence employee motivation is through designing work places that encourage engagement. We'll begin with a discussion of engagement, and why so many companies are intent on increasing it. Then we break it down by discussing ways of designing jobs to make them more intrinsically interesting to employees. Techniques such as job enrichment, job enlargement, and job crafting will be covered. In addition, we cover the topic of delegation to increase feelings of employee empowerment. Finally, we discuss the important balance between engagement and burnout. The goal is to help you design a work place that encourages engaged employees who bring their whole selves to work, are motivated to accomplish organizational objectives, and who thrive rather than burnout in the process.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Understand the key factors leading to employee engagement and burnout.
- Design jobs that are more intrinsically interesting to employees.
- Know when, why and how to delegate for maximum effectiveness and empowerment.

## 8.1 Intrinsic Motivation & Job Design

> Most people aren't anywhere near to realizing their creative potential, in part because they are laboring in environments that impede intrinsic motivation. --- Prof. Teresa Amabile

### Intrinsic Motivation

A person engages in behavior because it is personally rewarding.

It reflects passion for particular activities, but can also be influenced by managers through:

- Goal accomplishment
- A meaningful purpose
- Choice over process
- Feedback on performance

### When Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations Collide

performance can decrease with increased rewards. The _over-justification effect_ occurs when offering excessive external rewards for a task that is already intrinsically interesting, reduces motivation.

### Extrinsic Rewards Can Be Good For

- Motivating tasks where is little initial interest
- Motivating skill development
- Providing external feedback on performance
- Praise (external recognition) can increase internal motivation by building _self-efficacy_ (confidence in capability to perform)

### Extrinsic Rewards Can Undermine Intrinsic Motivation When

- They are awarded for minimal work.
- They become expected.
- They are handed out freely, with little regard to performance.

### Design Intrinsically Interesting Jobs

- Managers can influence the motivating level of a job by influencing core characteristics of the job.
- Hackman & Oldham’s _Theory of Job Design_ provides 5 ways to change jobs, influence psychological states and impact performance.

### Theory of Job Design

- Core Job Characteristics
  - Skill variety
  - Task identity
  - Task significance
  - Autonomy
  - Feedback
- Psychological States
  - Meaningfulness
  - Responsibility
  - Knowledge of results
- Outcomes
  - Motivation
  - Performance
  - Satisfaction
  - Absenteeism
  - Turnover

### Job Characteristics

- **Skill variety** – increase the number of different activities, skills & talents used
- **Task identity** – expand the job to cover a task from beginning to end
- **Task significance** – emphasize the job’s impact on the lives or work of others
- **Autonomy** – increase the degree of discretion in scheduling work & determining procedures
- **Feedback** from the _job_ – increase the degree to which performing the job provides direct & clear information on effectiveness.

### Employee Engagement

The Immersion of self into work roles, employing and expressing physical, mental and emotional energy for work.

Job demands are typically _inversely_ related to engagement, but if demands are viewed as _challenges_, the relationship reverses.

### 3 Keys to Engagement

- _Meaning_ - "What I do matters to others and the world"
- _Support_ - "Freedom to be who I am and can take risks to try things"
- _Competence_ - "I know what I'm doing and can do it well, or can find resources to improve"

### How can you raise your own level of engagement

A recent "diary study" of 187 individuals in different industries and organizations, results found that people use of time management had a strong relationship with daily engagement & productivity.

- Night before planning of next day.
- Create boundaries around time to prevent interruptions.
- If few anticipated interruptions, set ambitious to-do-list
- If several anticipated interruptions, set contingency plans.

## 8.2 Empowered Delegation

> Surround yourself with the best people you can find, delegate authority, and don't interfere as long as the policy you've decided upon is being carried out. --- Ronald Reagan

### What is Delegation

Definition: The assignment of authority to another person to carry out specific job-related activities.

The inability to delegate has led to the downfall of many executives.

- _Vertical delegation_ - requires active coaching and knowing your people's skill sets.
- _Horizontal delegation_ - requires influence skills and political savvy.

Delegation is NOT:

- (Just) A way to get more work done
- Simply assigning tasks to someone
- A test to see whether someone is capable
- Abdicating responsibility or accountability for the final results.

**Delegation IS**: A way to get the work done and empower and develop others.

Empowered individuals should experience the following:

- Self-efficacy - I have confidence in my capability to perform activities
- Impact - I believe it is possible to have a significant impact on the job and work environment.
- Meaningfulness - I value the purpose of what I'm doing.
- Trust - I feel secure enough to take risks.

### Not Everything is Appropriate to Delegate

Inappropriate items for delegation generally include:

- Complaints from employees or customers regarding another employee
- Allegations of professional or personal misconduct
- Distribution of bonus money or rewards
- Notification that someone has received a job offer from a competitor, is intending to leave the company, has requested a transfer, etc.
- Strategic decisions regarding allocation of resources.

### 5 Steps for Effective Delegation

1. Analyze the task -- is appropriate?
2. Select the right person: (1) Understand current capabilities; (2) Know how to stretch a person but _not break_ them.
3. Assign the task
4. Allow them to execute the task
5. Conduct regular feedback sessions to monitor and evaluate progress.

## Be Yourself -- More with Skill

### How Can We Become More Effective As Leaders and As Developers of Leaders

The answer lies in an explicit recognition of three fundamental axioms about leadership.

- Situational

  First, leadership is situational. What is required of the leader will always be influenced by the situation. The ability to observe and understand existing situations, called _situation sensing_, is key to leadership. This involves a mixture of sensory and cognitive abilities. Effective leaders pick up important situational signals. They are able to tune into the organizational frequency to understand what is going on beneath the surface.

- Nonhierarchical

  Second, leadership is nonhierarchical. While we recognize that there is a relationship between hierarchy and leadership, we view the leadership as contingent. Being given a particular organizational title may confer some hierarchical authority, but it certainly does not make you a leader. Hierarchy alone is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for the exercise of leadership.

  Successful organizations seek to build leadership capability widely and to give people the opportunity to exercise it.

- Relational

  The third foundation is that leadership is relational. Put simply, you cannot be a leader without followers.

### Making Sense of Authenticity

1. First, authentic leaders display a _consistency between words and deeds_. Leaders who do what they say -- who practice what they preach -- are more likely seen as "genuine" and therefore authentic.

2. The second element of authentic leadership is the capacity to display _coherence in role performances_. In other words, despite the unavoidable need to play different roles at different times for different audiences, authentic leaders _communicate a consistent underlying thread_. They display a "real self" that holds these separate performances together.

3. The third and final element: authentic leadership involves a kind of _comfort with self_, which is perhaps the hardest aspect of all to attain.

### Me Myself

Effective leaders know individual differences that might help them in a leadership role and use them to their advantage.

Three powerful ways in which leaders have been able to hone their sensing abilities.

1. The first is early exposure to a range of different experiences.

2. The second successful approach seems to be structured, experience-based learning where individuals are exposed to a range of direct experiences and helped to learn from them by skilled facilitators. Witness the remarkable growth of business school interpersonal skills programs, and 360-degree survey feedback.

3. The third approach is the use of a personal coach.

Effective leaders do not simply react to context. They also shape it -- by illuminating aspects of the situation that they can turn to their advantage.

If leadership is a relationship, then followers also have a vital part to play. The four elements followers want from leaders are authenticity, significance, excitement, and community. Effective leaders understand and deliver on these four key issues.

### Inspirational Tension

First, to demonstrate the maturity required to understand and deploy weakness as well as strength. Second, to know when to get close and when to remain apart from followers. Third, to appreciate that individual expression must be balanced with the need to conform _enough_.

# 1 Becoming a Better Manager

In this module we will cover the fundamental challenge of being a manager - being ultimately responsible for the performance of your unit . . . through the performance of others. We review research by Linda Hill, who studies the disconnect between the idealized version of "Becoming a Manager" and the realities of the role.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Articulate the fundamental managerial dilemma
- Understand causes for managerial derailment
- Discern the realities from the myths of management

## Fundamental Manager's Challenge

- You are held accountable by superiors for work unit results, but you are dependent on the efforts of others to make these results possible.

- No longer enough that you are good at your technical work, but now you have to harness the capacity of others.

## Managerial Skill Progression

- **Conceptual skills:** the ability to think analytically & achieve integrative problem solving
- **Human skills:** the ability to work well in relationships with other people at multiple levels
- **Technical skills:** the ability to apply expertise and perform a special task proficiently

### Evidence-Based Management

Basing management practices on critical thinking and the best available evidence. Similar to evidence-based medicine, the idea is to tap into what well-constructed research shows works.

### Preventing Managerial Derailment

A study of 62 senior executives from US, Belgium, German, France, Italy, UK, & Spain explored WHY careers derailed:

- Failure to meet business objectives
- Problems with interpersonal relationships
- Failure to build & lead a team
- Inability to change or adapt during transitions

## Myths of Management - Professor Linda Hill, Harvard University

Management is about:

- freedom
- formal authority
- gaining compliance
- building one-on-one relationships
- solving problems.

### #1 Reality: Managers do not have more freedom

You will have less freedom in the new position, because you are more interdependent on others.

You are embedded in a network of relationships that you need to rely on to accomplish objectives

### #2 Reality: Management is not “just” about formal authority

Formal authority means that you have reward and punishment power – types of positional power.

To use it effectively, you must earn the right to use it through developing personal power through credibility and influence.

### #3 Reality: Management is not about gaining compliance

Managers can generate 3 outcomes:

- Resistance – active or passive.
- Compliance – people deliver the minimum required
- Commitment – people give their highest potential, because it matters to them personally

### #4 Reality: Management is not just about good one-on-one relationships

Good dyadic relationships matter, but you want to avoid differences in your leader-member exchange (LMX) quality.

Developing a good team dynamic is even more important than good one-on-one relationships.

Building a culture of engagement and high performance is your ultimate goal.

### #5 Reality: Management is not just about solving existing problems

Of course you need to attend to problem areas. You need to keep the trains running. But the best managers are also LEADERS . . .

LEADERS see a need to make things better, and make changes to the system.

> Management is responsibility for the performance of a group of people. --― Linda A. Hill

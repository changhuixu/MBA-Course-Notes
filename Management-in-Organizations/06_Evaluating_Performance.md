# 6 Evaluating Performance, Providing Feedback & Coaching

As a manager you are ultimately responsible for the work of others contributing to the achievement of organizational goals. In order to align individual performance with unit objectives, providing accurate and fair assessments of performance is a necessary first step. After evaluation, however, performance is most affected by the provision of valuable feedback and coaching with specific intent to improve performance. If poor performance is not addressed, it **WILL** continue. We will cover the basics of documenting performance problems for progressive discipline. For top performers, performance management also matters, because everyone wants to develop and grow. Helping top performers identify ways to achieve their career goals is just as important as correcting performance concerns.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Design a process for evaluating performance based on behaviors and results
- Articulate keys to providing developmental feedback that is more likely to be heard
- Design a coaching process to encourage employees to their performance goals
- Document performance problems for progressive discipline
- [Reasonably] comfortably engage in a performance review and coaching discussion.

## Performance Management

Consist of efforts aimed at _evaluating_ and _improving_ employees' work behaviors.

3 steps to effective performance management:

1. Evaluating Performance
2. Providing Feedback
3. Coaching for Change

### Step 1: Evaluating Performance

Performance criteria are the basis for:

- pay, promotion, training & development opportunities,
- layoffs, terminations
- judging the criterion-related validity of selection practices.

What Matters Most?

The focus has traditionally been on improving _accuracy_. But the system also has to be _understandable_, _acceptable_, and _perceived as fair_.

#### How will you assess performance?

- **Trait0based criteria**: subjective character traits (e.g., hard worker, motivated, conscientious).
  - LEAST PREFERRED type of evaluation, because it's highly subjective and hard to observe.
- **Results-based criteria**: focus on outcomes or reaching set goals (e.g., meeting sales quota, service quality ratings).
  - MORE PREFERRED because results are observable and measurable.
  - Has the drawback of ignoring how the results were achieved, and assumes control over results.
- **Behavior-based criteria**: focus on behaviors/process (e.g., number of new contacts made, number of sales calls made).
  - MORE PREFERRED because behaviors can be observed, are more under the individuals' control.
  - The drawback is that it accounts more for effort than results.

#### Should you Rate or Rank?

- Absolute performance is best assessed using a _rating_ (Above average, Average, Below Average)
- Relative performance is better assess using a comparative _ranking_ (1st, 2nd, bottom quartile)
- Rating is preferred by most people, but ranking differentiates individuals.

#### Sources for Evaluations

- Supervisors are typically the evaluator.
- Many companies use _self-ratings_. They tend to be positively biased, but have the benefit of prompting self-reflection prior to the meeting.
- _360-degree methods_ involve feedback from subordinates, peers, customers (internal & external), and self.
  - Used to avoid some rater errors and give holistic view
  - But these have their own issues with honesty, appropriate sampling, retribution.

#### The Impact of Informal

Don't replace informal feedback with formal meetings.

Informal feedback, close in time to the behavior, is your most powerful weapon to influence behavior change.

### Step 2: Providing Feedback

> Feedback is the breakfast of champions. --- Ken Blanchard

Providing feedback is critical to improving performance, but few people do it effectively. Too many managers are unwilling to confront problem subordinates.

Why are people reluctant to give feedback?

- Want to avoid their anger and hostility.
- Fear of not being liked, of hurting the person, of retaliation.
- Fear that it will make things worse.
- Frustration that nothing ever changes.

#### Two Types of Feedback

- **Developmental Feedback**
  - For shaping future performance
  - Qualitative feedback with few consequences attached
- **Evaluation Feedback**
  - At the completion of a designated time period
  - Quantitative assessment (and qualitative if desired) provides a summative evaluation to assess performance.

#### Characteristics of Good Feedback

- **Valuable**: explain why it is useful to them, not just for you
- **Prepared**: know what you are going to say, so you get to the key points
- **Timely**: while situation is still relevant, but not raw
- **Specific**: focus on one or two key issues
- **Descriptive**: support with observations & descriptions
- Focused on **Behaviors**, not personality or person
- **Balanced**: inquiry (listening) & advocacy (telling)
- **Private**: in public people are often more concerned about what others are thinking than about the content of the feedback itself.

#### Receiving Constructive Feedback

- Avoid being defensive:
  - Don't argue or interrupt.
  - Silence is often the best approach so that you are listening.
  - Ask for examples -- non-defensively.
- Ask for specific suggestions for how you could improve
- Take time to think about the feedback before responding.
- Don't engage in retribution! The person is trying to help you (usually).

### Step 3: Coaching

The purpose of coaching is to _create an action plan for improvement_.

#### Characteristics of Effective Coaching

- If possible, hold this meeting separately from the feedback session to allow the person time to digest what was said
- Work with the person to determine ways to improve performance
- Model desired behaviors.
- Ask questions to diagnose the root of performance problems
- Jointly determine plan for improvement with the following:
  - Specific goals
  - Timelines
  - Action steps
  - Resources needed
  - Expected outcomes

## Myths about feedback -- CCL White Paper

### Summary of findings

- Well over half (65%) of individuals receive feedback at least on a monthly basis; 38% are getting feedback even more frequently on a weekly basis â€” if not daily.
- Though individuals receive a lot more positive feedback (77%) than negative feedback (23%) from their bosses, they actually want more negative feedback. Specifically, individuals would prefer to get a little less positive outcome feedback (i.e., "Good job") and a little more of both negative outcome and negative process than what they are actually getting.
- Individuals reported giving a lot more feedback to their subordinates on a weekly, if not daily basis (71%) than what they personally receive from their own boss (38%).
- There are some trends based on demographic differences:
  - Men are getting more feedback than women.
  - Front-line leaders give less feedback to their direct reports compared to higher-level leaders.
  - Young leaders give less feedback than their older counterparts.
  - Despite some slight differences, all individuals would like to receive a little less positive outcome feedback (i.e., "Good job") and a little more of both negative outcome and negative process than what they are actually getting.
- Individuals with highly effective bosses receive a lot more feedback (54%) than those with ineffective bosses (26%) on at least a weekly basis, if not daily. And, highly effective bosses give more positive process feedback.

# 5.1 Managing Conflict

Managers deal with conflict daily, whether it is in managing their teams, negotiating a deal, or handling a disgruntled employee. This week we'll learn to diagnose different types of conflict, and learn the optimal types for teamwork. In addition, we'll cover 5 ways of managing conflict, and learn when each is appropriate to use. Pulling together the content we've covered up to this point, you will analyze your first case as a team: Henry Tam. You and your team members will put together a memo analyzing Henry's challenges, and propose a solution and specific action plan for how to address the issues in their multicultural team.

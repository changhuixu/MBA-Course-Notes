# 11 Aligning Vision, Strategy, Culture & Structure

The broader organizational context sets the environment in which goals are set, cultures develop and organizational structures are created. In this week, we cover at a very macro level, how all the pieces of vision, strategy, organizational culture and structure are related. We will discuss the need for alignment or congruence between these various pieces, in order to effectively accomplish the organization's goals. Understanding this broader context helps a manager to understand how the environment in which he or she works can be an important factor in determining the success of the manager.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Understand the principle of alignment or congruence, and how it relates to organizational effectiveness
- Understand the fundamentals of organizational culture and structure
- Be able to describe the positives and negatives associated with any organizational structure or culture
- Map an organization's culture and anticipate the managerial competencies that will be most valued in it

## Alignment & Organization Culture

> Strategically aligned enterprises have a much better chance of winning in today’s challenging business environment. To win, enterprise leaders must find their own distinctive approach to aligning their business strategies, organizational capabilities, valuable resources, and management systems to fulfill their enterprise’s purpose. --- Jonathan Trevor & Barry Varcoe

### Alignment Matters

- Strategic Management: The greater the alignment between the organization and its competitive environment, the better the organization’s performance
- Organizational Design: The greater the alignment among the internal components of an organization, the more effective the organization will be translating strategy into performance

### Culture

**What Is Culture?**

A system of shared values (that define what is important) and norms that define appropriate attitudes & behaviors for organizational members.

The “way things are done around here”

Occurs at the national level, organizational level, and others.

**Why does it matter?**
Culture establishes norms that powerfully shape individual behavior

- It determines how employees view the world, and react to it within organizational boundaries
- Norms: expectations by employees about what’s appropriate & inappropriate.
- Social standards can be more powerful than even rule-based, standards

**What is Organizational Culture?**

1. Underlying Values, Beliefs, Assumptions
   - Values of founder & leaders regarding nature of business & people
1. Strategies, Goals, Philosophies
   - Objectives the organization is directing its attention to and hopes to achieve
1. Behavioral Artifacts
   - Easily visible physical & social signs (i.e., space; dress; stories; ceremonies; vision statements; awards; events)

**What does culture do?**

Internal:

- Coordination: Facilitates communication provides collective identity.
- Control: Defines what is acceptable through social control.
- Commitment: Makes people feel a part of a bigger community (good for retention)

External:

- Competence: Provides organizational identity and brand for “what we are/what we do” to outsiders, which aids in recruitment

**Can culture be dysfunctional? YES!**

- If misaligned with the external environment.
- Cultural inertia: inflexibility & missed opportunities
- Icarus Paradox – your greatest strength becomes your weakness
- Culture conflicts when companies merge.

## Organization Structure

> We saw departments and functions that live in narrow silos and don’t see out to the other silos. We have to take down the walls and allow for freer flows of information and cooperation. --- David Pockell

Simple structures work for small organizations, but as they grow, increasing numbers of employees must be coordinated.

Structure creates lines of communication that distinguish units and reporting relationships.

### 3 Key Decisions in Structure

- Differentiation/Groupings: Grouping some jobs together while creating boundaries between others.
- Coordination/Integration: Connecting units created by grouping so that they are coordinated.
- Boundary creation: Establishes what is internal and external to the organization, and how it will interface.

1. First, you choose how to group jobs

   - Functionally (activity)
   - Geographic (location)
   - Product (output)

1. Second, you choose how to connect them

   - Vertical integration - Formal Hierarchy

     - Positions are coordinated by the boss who oversees them
     - Works well wen the work is homogeneous and the environment is slow to change; not responsive to environmental changes.
     - Can be facilitated with rules & plans, and standard operating procedures
     - **_Best for_**: Control, efficiency, stability, reliability

   - Horizontal Coordination - Formal and informal

     - More diverse work, and rapid change implies that units need to be more interdependent.
     - Cross-functional task forces; interdepartmental rotations & events; co-location; knowledge management systems; consistent measurement & reward systems.
     - **_Best for_**: Coordination, learning, innovation, flexibility
     - Within any unit there will be better communication and grater goal focus than across units. So new structures evolved that promoted both coordination and specialization.

   - Matrix Organizations
     - highly integrated structure established to promote coordination.

### Structure Characteristics

- **Specialization**: how much tasks are subdivided into separate jobs
- **Chain of Command**: who a person or group reports to
- **Span of Control**: how many people a manager directs
  - Wide SOC = Flat Organization
  - Narrow SOC = Tall Organization
- **Centralization**: how much decision-responsibility is located at the “top”
- **Formalization**: how much rules and regulations direct employee behaviors

### Every structure has strengths and weaknesses

- Functional:

  - (+) economies of scale; satisfied employees; predictable careers
  - (-) poor for innovation & coordination

- Product/Customer/Geography:

  - (+) adaptable to customer/product/region
  - (-) duplication of resources; low coordination across areas

- Matrix:
  - (+) high coordination; good for complex products
  - (-) role confusion for employees; no unity of command; slow

### In the End It's About Alignment

- Structure, Strategy and Culture should all align
- Simple designs are easier to manage, but may be insufficient to achieve the strategic goal
- Structures can change quickly, but without changes in the other parts of the organization (Culture, People, Work) they won't work

> The art of architecture studies not structure in itself, but the effect of structure on the human spirit. --- Geoffrey Scott

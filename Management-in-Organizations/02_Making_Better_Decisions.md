# 2.1 Making Better Decisions

This week we're covering decision making - a fundamental responsibility of all managers. We cover rational versus intuitive decision making, and when each is appropriate. We'll take a deep dive into heuristics (biases) that influence all types of decisions, and cover strategies for identifying and reducing their impact. Finally, we'll cover the importance of considering ethics in decision making, and how what is ethical in one culture, may be perceived differently elsewhere.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Understand the steps of rational decision making and when to use it
- Recognize common heuristics and how to identify and reduce them
- Diagnose the ethical considerations in managerial decisions and apply a rational model to ethical decision making

# Leading & Influencing Others

## Introduction and Objectives

Are managers different than leaders? Although managers may be excellent at what they do, only when they motivate others to a common goal do they become leaders. Rather than the old notion that leaders are "born" and not "made", we look at behavior patterns that leaders use to motivate others to move toward their desired goal. Behaviors are teachable, making leadership accessible for all. We examine similarities between leaders who have accomplished great and terrible things in history. We will look at different types of behaviors, including task-focused, relationship-focused, and transformational. In transformational leadership we discuss the idea of vision - which many consider to be the hallmark of a leader. We will cover what makes a good vision, and what behaviors can be used to convey it to others. Finally, we address the topic of influence - how a manager or leader can get others to do things that they want. We cover specific tactics that managers and leaders can use to solicit the behaviors that they want from others, and when certain tactics are likely to be more successful.

## 9.1 Power and Influence

### Power

Power is the potential of a person or group to influence another.

When evaluating the use of power, consider:

- Is it effective for the organization?
- Is it ethical? (expand the stakeholders)

### Position Power

- Positions are more powerful if they are:
  - Central
  - Relevant to strategic priorities
  - Autonomous
  - Visible

### Personal Power

Comes from qualities of the individual

- **Expert power**: Expertise, skills, track record.
- **Referent power**: Based on admiration & the desire to be like someone.
- **Effort**: your commitment and how hard you're working

The primary currency on which your personal power base resides is **_CREDIBILITY_**.

### Relationships are an additional source of power

Relational power comes from resources provided by others:

- Information
- Tangible resources
- Advice and support

Resides in your network: through your network you build social capital.

### Tie Strength

Strong ties involve frequent contact, longevity, and emotional attachment.

Weak ties are less frequent contact, or new, and have little depth.

The _strength of weak ties_ comes from their ability to connect groups and provide unique information.

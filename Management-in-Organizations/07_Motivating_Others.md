# Motivating Others

Everyone is motivated to do something... it just may not be what you're hoping for. Harnessing employee motivation to direct it toward organizational goals is one of your key challenges as a manager. We all can think of things that we think will work, such as "offer a bigger reward!" In times of scarce resources, however, bigger rewards are not always the answer. In fact, offering rewards can generated unintended negative consequences. In this unit you will learn multiple strategies for harnessing motivation through extrinsic motivators (like rewards) and other techniques such as goal setting and promoting procedural justice and attending to equity. Together you can put together a comprehensive strategy to channel the motivation of your employees to achieve organizational goals.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Understand multiple theories of human motivation and how to implement them.
- Diagnose the likely impact (positive or negative) of rewards.
- Articulate multiple types of justice and how it influences employee motivation.
- Understand the various types of equity involved in salary decisions.

## 7.1 Motivating Others - Goals, Needs, Reinforcement

> Motivation is everything. You can do the work of two people, but you can't be two people. Instead, you have to inspire the next guy down the line and get him to inspire his people. --- Lee Iacocca, CEO & President, Ford

### Motivation Defined

The internal, psychological factors that push and/or pull people to action.

Nearly everyone is motivated, the question for manager is "to do what?"

> Performance = (Motivation X Ability X Opportunity)
>
> - Motivation: (1) Desire (2) Commitment;
> - Ability: (1) Aptitude (2) Training;
> - Opportunity: Resources

If there is a _performance problem_, the first step is to determine its root cause:
Ability; Opportunity; Motivation.

- If the problem is ABILITY:

  - **Resupply**: provide additional resources
  - **Retrain**: provide additional skill development
  - **Refit**: changing elements of the job to fit the employee
  - **Reassign**: move employee to a different job
  - **Release**: terminate

- If the problem is OPPORTUNITY:

  - Determine what is in the way of success.
  - Provide resources that allow the person to perform more effectively.
  - Change the context.

- If the problem is MOTIVATION:
  - You've got a lot of tools to choose from to increase and direct motivation.
  - Motivation stems from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
    - **Intrinsic factors** are built into the job itself.
    - **Extrinsic factors** are created by someone else to influence performance.

### Strategy 1: Set GOALS

- Goals influence what people will focus on and how long they will persist.
- Research on _goal setting theory_ shows that a goal alone (even without external rewards) motivates behavior.
- Goals only work if people are committed to them (self-set or set by others).

**SMART Goals**: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time Based.

"Do your best goals" do NOT lead to the best outcome.

### Strategy 2: Determine what people NEED and Give it to Them

Many traditional theories of needs (i.e., Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs). All useful in some ways, but not incredibly well supported by research.

Current consensus is that there are some fundamental needs:

- The drive to **A**chieve (shown by acquiring & accomplishment)
- The drive to **B**ond or relate to others
- The drive to **C**omprehend and master
- The drive to **D**efend and promote justice

### Strategy 3: Use REWARDS & DISCIPLINE to shape behavior

Behavior is a function of its consequences --- B.F. Skinner's _reinforcement theory_

Thorndike's Law of Effect -- behavior is repeated if met with satisfying results, and extinguished if met with unsatisfying results.

Reinforcement is usually better for long-term consequences, but punishment offers immediate relief.

- Reinforcement

  - Rewards a person for desired behavior
    - Positive - give something good (praise, reward)
    - Negative - take away something aversive (probation)

- Punishment

  - Negatively affects a person for an undesired behavior
    - Punishment - give something negative (fine, penalty)
    - Extinction - take away something positive (limit access)

- Vroom's Expectancy Theory

  People are motivated when effort results in performance, which results in valued rewards.

> A goal should scare you a little, and excite you a lot. --- Joe Vitale

## 7.2 Motivating Others -- Recognition and Rewards, Equity and Fairness

### Strategy 4: Provide Recognition

Can be used to:

- Motivate performance
- Recruit & retain employees
- Promote skill acquisition & knowledge development
- Shape organizational culture

Recognition works. Don't underestimate the power of social recognition for good performance.

- Average performance increase of 17% when social recognition used as an intervention.
- JetBlue peer-to-peer recognition found for every 10% increase in recognition, there was 3% increase in retention and 2% increase in engagement.
- Higher increases when combined with performance feedback.
- Employees favor recognition from managers and supervisors 2:1 over coworkers.

It provides information on performance (qualitative feedback), signals other positive rewards, and builds self-efficacy.

### Strategy 5: Be Fair in Allocating Rewards

People will lost motivation if they feel they have been treated unfairly. 2 key types of justice:

- **Distributive Justice** -- are my outcomes fair?
- **Procedural Justice** -- was the process fair?

How do we determine if our outcomes are fair?

Adams' _Equity Theory_ says that we compare our input and outcome ratio to "relevant others".

What is an Equitable Salary?

- **External Equity** - Market Pay: what are employees in other companies paid for doing my job?
- **Internal Equity** - Within Company Pay: what are employees in my organization paid for doing my job?

When there is an active job market for talent, external equity wins the day. Pay secrecy policies are used to minimize easy comparisons... but they often don't work and are perceived as signals of inequity.

### Strategy 6: Use a Fair Process

Even if people don't like the outcomes, perceptions of procedural justice matter.

- The procedures used in making the decisions are FAIR (consistency, accuracy, ethicality, lack of bias)
- They had a VOICE in the process
- Mistakes are CORRECTABLE (by a grievance process)

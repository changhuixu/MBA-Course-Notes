# Management in Organizations

## 1 Becoming a Better Manager

In this module we will cover the fundamental challenge of being a manager - being ultimately responsible for the performance of your unit . . . through the performance of others. We review research by Linda Hill, who studies the disconnect between the idealized version of "Becoming a Manager" and the realities of the role.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Articulate the fundamental managerial dilemma
- Understand causes for managerial derailment
- Discern the realities from the myths of management

> The test of a manager is not how good s(he) is at bossing, but how little bossing s(he) has to do. --- Mary Parker Follett

### Fundamental Manager's Challenge

- You are held accountable by superiors for work unit results, but you are dependent on the efforts of others to make these results possible.

- No longer enough that you are good at your technical work, but now you have to harness the capacity of others.

### Managerial Skill Progression

- **Conceptual skills:** the ability to think analytically & achieve integrative problem solving
- **Human skills:** the ability to work well in relationships with other people at multiple levels
- **Technical skills:** the ability to apply expertise and perform a special task proficiently

### Evidence-Based Management

Basing management practices on critical thinking and the best available evidence. Similar to evidence-based medicine, the idea is to tap into what well-constructed research shows works.

### Preventing Managerial Derailment

A study of 62 senior executives from US, Belgium, German, France, Italy, UK, & Spain explored WHY careers derailed:

- Failure to meet business objectives
- Problems with interpersonal relationships
- Failure to build & lead a team
- Inability to change or adapt during transitions

### Myths of Management - Professor Linda Hill, Harvard University

Management is about:

- freedom
- formal authority
- gaining compliance
- building one-on-one relationships
- solving problems.

#### #1 Reality: Managers do not have more freedom

You will have less freedom in the new position, because you are more interdependent on others.

You are embedded in a network of relationships that you need to rely on to accomplish objectives

#### #2 Reality: Management is not “just” about formal authority

Formal authority means that you have reward and punishment power – types of positional power.

To use it effectively, you must earn the right to use it through developing personal power through credibility and influence.

#### #3 Reality: Management is not about gaining compliance

Managers can generate 3 outcomes:

- Resistance – active or passive.
- Compliance – people deliver the minimum required
- Commitment – people give their highest potential, because it matters to them personally

#### #4 Reality: Management is not just about good one-on-one relationships

Good dyadic relationships matter, but you want to avoid differences in your leader-member exchange (LMX) quality.

Developing a good team dynamic is even more important than good one-on-one relationships.

Building a culture of engagement and high performance is your ultimate goal.

#### #5 Reality: Management is not just about solving existing problems

Of course you need to attend to problem areas. You need to keep the trains running. But the best managers are also LEADERS . . .

LEADERS see a need to make things better, and make changes to the system.

> Management is responsibility for the performance of a group of people. --― Linda A. Hill

## 2.1 Making Better Decisions

This week we're covering decision making - a fundamental responsibility of all managers. We cover rational versus intuitive decision making, and when each is appropriate. We'll take a deep dive into heuristics (biases) that influence all types of decisions, and cover strategies for identifying and reducing their impact. Finally, we'll cover the importance of considering ethics in decision making, and how what is ethical in one culture, may be perceived differently elsewhere.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Understand the steps of rational decision making and when to use it
- Recognize common heuristics and how to identify and reduce them
- Diagnose the ethical considerations in managerial decisions and apply a rational model to ethical decision making

> Making good decisions is a crucial skill at every level. --- Peter Drucker

## 5.1 Managing Conflict

Managers deal with conflict daily, whether it is in managing their teams, negotiating a deal, or handling a disgruntled employee. This week we'll learn to diagnose different types of conflict, and learn the optimal types for teamwork. In addition, we'll cover 5 ways of managing conflict, and learn when each is appropriate to use. Pulling together the content we've covered up to this point, you will analyze your first case as a team: Henry Tam. You and your team members will put together a memo analyzing Henry's challenges, and propose a solution and specific action plan for how to address the issues in their multicultural team.

> For good ideas and true innovation, you need human interaction, conflict, argument, debate. -- Margaret Heffernan

### What is Conflict

- Conflict is
  A process that begins with perceived incompatibilities or discrepant views among the parties involved.

### Sources of Conflict

- "Faultlines" in groups:
  - "Faultlines" in the group, particularly likely to emerge when attributes of members form distinct, non-overlapping categories.
  - Can be surface-level (demographic) or deep-level (values).
- Individual differences:
  - People just "rub you the wrong way" – personality based
  - Individual goals that conflict.
  - Individual values that conflict.
- Information deficiencies:
  - Factual discrepancies or simply not sharing information
- Role ambiguity or incompatibility:
  - Lack of clarity and consensus on who will do what for the team
- Environmentally induced stress
  - Scarcity, deadlines, and uncertainty

### Different types of conflict

- **Task Conflict:** problem-focused; disagreements about the tasks being performed
- **Relationship Conflict:** interpersonal incompatibilities among parties
- **Process:** disagreements about the means to accomplish specific tasks

### Optimal Conflict Profile

- Moderate _task conflict_, starting at the midpoint of group life
- Low _relational conflict_ throughout group life.
- Moderate _process conflict_ starting early, but decreasing over time

> Whenever you're in conflict with someone, there is one factor that can make the difference between damaging your relationship and deepening it. That factor is attitude. --- William James

## 6.1 Evaluating Performance

As a manager you are ultimately responsible for the work of others contributing to the achievement of organizational goals. In order to align individual performance with unit objectives, providing accurate and fair assessments of performance is a necessary first step. After evaluation, however, performance is most affected by the provision of valuable feedback and coaching with specific intent to improve performance. If poor performance is not addressed, it **WILL** continue. We will cover the basics of documenting performance problems for progressive discipline. For top performers, performance management also matters, because everyone wants to develop and grow. Helping top performers identify ways to achieve their career goals is just as important as correcting performance concerns.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Design a process for evaluating performance based on behaviors and results
- Articulate keys to providing developmental feedback that is more likely to be heard
- Design a coaching process to encourage employees to their performance goals
- Document performance problems for progressive discipline
- [Reasonably] comfortably engage in a performance review and coaching discussion.

> What you can't measure, you can't control. What you can't control, you can't improve. --- Guillermo Colin Garcia

### Performance Management

Consist of efforts aimed at _evaluating_ and _improving_ employees' work behaviors.

3 steps to effective performance management:

1. Evaluating Performance
2. Providing Feedback
3. Coaching for Change

### Step 1: Evaluating Performance

Performance criteria are the basis for:

- pay, promotion, training & development opportunities,
- layoffs, terminations
- judging the criterion-related validity of selection practices.

What Matters Most?

The focus has traditionally been on improving _accuracy_. But the system also has to be _understandable_, _acceptable_, and _perceived as fair_.

#### How will you assess performance?

- **Trait0based criteria**: subjective character traits (e.g., hard worker, motivated, conscientious).
  - LEAST PREFERRED type of evaluation, because it's highly subjective and hard to observe.
- **Results-based criteria**: focus on outcomes or reaching set goals (e.g., meeting sales quota, service quality ratings).
  - MORE PREFERRED because results are observable and measurable.
  - Has the drawback of ignoring how the results were achieved, and assumes control over results.
- **Behavior-based criteria**: focus on behaviors/process (e.g., number of new contacts made, number of sales calls made).
  - MORE PREFERRED because behaviors can be observed, are more under the individuals' control.
  - The drawback is that it accounts more for effort than results.

#### Should you Rate or Rank?

- Absolute performance is best assessed using a _rating_ (Above average, Average, Below Average)
- Relative performance is better assess using a comparative _ranking_ (1st, 2nd, bottom quartile)
- Rating is preferred by most people, but ranking differentiates individuals.

#### Sources for Evaluations

- Supervisors are typically the evaluator.
- Many companies use _self-ratings_. They tend to be positively biased, but have the benefit of prompting self-reflection prior to the meeting.
- _360-degree methods_ involve feedback from subordinates, peers, customers (internal & external), and self.
  - Used to avoid some rater errors and give holistic view
  - But these have their own issues with honesty, appropriate sampling, retribution.

#### The Impact of Informal

Don't replace informal feedback with formal meetings.

Informal feedback, close in time to the behavior, is your most powerful weapon to influence behavior change.

> The test of an organization is not genius. It is its capacity to make common people achieve uncommon performance. --- Peter Drucker

---

## 6.2 Providing Feedback & Coaching

> Feedback is the breakfast of champions. --- Ken Blanchard

### Step 2: Providing Feedback

Providing feedback is critical to improving performance, but few people do it effectively. Too many managers are unwilling to confront problem subordinates.

Why are people reluctant to give feedback?

- Want to avoid their anger and hostility.
- Fear of not being liked, of hurting the person, of retaliation.
- Fear that it will make things worse.
- Frustration that nothing ever changes.

#### Two Types of Feedback

- **Developmental Feedback**
  - For shaping future performance
  - Qualitative feedback with few consequences attached
- **Evaluation Feedback**
  - At the completion of a designated time period
  - Quantitative assessment (and qualitative if desired) provides a summative evaluation to assess performance.

#### Characteristics of Good Feedback

- **Valuable**: explain why it is useful to them, not just for you
- **Prepared**: know what you are going to say, so you get to the key points
- **Timely**: while situation is still relevant, but not raw
- **Specific**: focus on one or two key issues
- **Descriptive**: support with observations & descriptions
- Focused on **Behaviors**, not personality or person
- **Balanced**: inquiry (listening) & advocacy (telling)
- **Private**: in public people are often more concerned about what others are thinking than about the content of the feedback itself.

#### Receiving Constructive Feedback

- Avoid being defensive:
  - Don't argue or interrupt.
  - Silence is often the best approach so that you are listening.
  - Ask for examples -- non-defensively.
- Ask for specific suggestions for how you could improve
- Take time to think about the feedback before responding.
- Don't engage in retribution! The person is trying to help you (usually).

### Step 3: Coaching

The purpose of coaching is to _create an action plan for improvement_.

#### Characteristics of Effective Coaching

- If possible, hold this meeting separately from the feedback session to allow the person time to digest what was said
- Work with the person to determine ways to improve performance
- Model desired behaviors.
- Ask questions to diagnose the root of performance problems
- Jointly determine plan for improvement with the following:
  - Specific goals
  - Timelines
  - Action steps
  - Resources needed
  - Expected outcomes

> The task of management is to make people capable of joint performance, to make their strengths effective, and their weaknesses irrelevant. --- Peter Drucker

## Myths about feedback -- CCL White Paper

### Summary of findings

- Well over half (65%) of individuals receive feedback at least on a monthly basis; 38% are getting feedback even more frequently on a weekly basis — if not daily.
- Though individuals receive a lot more positive feedback (77%) than negative feedback (23%) from their bosses, they actually want more negative feedback. Specifically, individuals would prefer to get a little less positive outcome feedback (i.e., "Good job") and a little more of both negative outcome and negative process than what they are actually getting.
- Individuals reported giving a lot more feedback to their subordinates on a weekly, if not daily basis (71%) than what they personally receive from their own boss (38%).
- There are some trends based on demographic differences:
  - Men are getting more feedback than women.
  - Front-line leaders give less feedback to their direct reports compared to higher-level leaders.
  - Young leaders give less feedback than their older counterparts.
  - Despite some slight differences, all individuals would like to receive a little less positive outcome feedback (i.e., "Good job") and a little more of both negative outcome and negative process than what they are actually getting.
- Individuals with highly effective bosses receive a lot more feedback (54%) than those with ineffective bosses (26%) on at least a weekly basis, if not daily. And, highly effective bosses give more positive process feedback.

## Motivating Others

Everyone is motivated to do something... it just may not be what you're hoping for. Harnessing employee motivation to direct it toward organizational goals is one of your key challenges as a manager. We all can think of things that we think will work, such as "offer a bigger reward!" In times of scarce resources, however, bigger rewards are not always the answer. In fact, offering rewards can generated unintended negative consequences. In this unit you will learn multiple strategies for harnessing motivation through extrinsic motivators (like rewards) and other techniques such as goal setting and promoting procedural justice and attending to equity. Together you can put together a comprehensive strategy to channel the motivation of your employees to achieve organizational goals.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Understand multiple theories of human motivation and how to implement them.
- Diagnose the likely impact (positive or negative) of rewards.
- Articulate multiple types of justice and how it influences employee motivation.
- Understand the various types of equity involved in salary decisions.

## 7.1 Motivating Others - Goals, Needs, Reinforcement

> Motivation is everything. You can do the work of two people, but you can't be two people. Instead, you have to inspire the next guy down the line and get him to inspire his people. --- Lee Iacocca, CEO & President, Ford

### Motivation Defined

The internal, psychological factors that push and/or pull people to action.

Nearly everyone is motivated, the question for manager is "to do what?"

> Performance = (Motivation X Ability X Opportunity)
>
> - Motivation: (1) Desire (2) Commitment;
> - Ability: (1) Aptitude (2) Training;
> - Opportunity: Resources

If there is a _performance problem_, the first step is to determine its root cause:
Ability; Opportunity; Motivation.

- If the problem is ABILITY:

  - **Resupply**: provide additional resources
  - **Retrain**: provide additional skill development
  - **Refit**: changing elements of the job to fit the employee
  - **Reassign**: move employee to a different job
  - **Release**: terminate

- If the problem is OPPORTUNITY:

  - Determine what is in the way of success.
  - Provide resources that allow the person to perform more effectively.
  - Change the context.

- If the problem is MOTIVATION:
  - You've got a lot of tools to choose from to increase and direct motivation.
  - Motivation stems from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
    - **Intrinsic factors** are built into the job itself.
    - **Extrinsic factors** are created by someone else to influence performance.

### Strategy 1: Set GOALS

- Goals influence what people will focus on and how long they will persist.
- Research on _goal setting theory_ shows that a goal alone (even without external rewards) motivates behavior.
- Goals only work if people are committed to them (self-set or set by others).

**SMART Goals**: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time Based.

"Do your best goals" do NOT lead to the best outcome.

### Strategy 2: Determine what people NEED and Give it to Them

Many traditional theories of needs (i.e., Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs). All useful in some ways, but not incredibly well supported by research.

Current consensus is that there are some fundamental needs:

- The drive to **A**chieve (shown by acquiring & accomplishment)
- The drive to **B**ond or relate to others
- The drive to **C**omprehend and master
- The drive to **D**efend and promote justice

### Strategy 3: Use REWARDS & DISCIPLINE to shape behavior

Behavior is a function of its consequences --- B.F. Skinner's _reinforcement theory_

Thorndike's Law of Effect -- behavior is repeated if met with satisfying results, and extinguished if met with unsatisfying results.

Reinforcement is usually better for long-term consequences, but punishment offers immediate relief.

- Reinforcement

  - Rewards a person for desired behavior
    - Positive - give something good (praise, reward)
    - Negative - take away something aversive (probation)

- Punishment

  - Negatively affects a person for an undesired behavior
    - Punishment - give something negative (fine, penalty)
    - Extinction - take away something positive (limit access)

- Vroom's Expectancy Theory

  People are motivated when effort results in performance, which results in valued rewards.

> A goal should scare you a little, and excite you a lot. --- Joe Vitale

---

## 7.2 Motivating Others -- Recognition and Rewards, Equity and Fairness

### Strategy 4: Provide Recognition

Can be used to:

- Motivate performance
- Recruit & retain employees
- Promote skill acquisition & knowledge development
- Shape organizational culture

Recognition works. Don't underestimate the power of social recognition for good performance.

- Average performance increase of 17% when social recognition used as an intervention.
- JetBlue peer-to-peer recognition found for every 10% increase in recognition, there was 3% increase in retention and 2% increase in engagement.
- Higher increases when combined with performance feedback.
- Employees favor recognition from managers and supervisors 2:1 over coworkers.

It provides information on performance (qualitative feedback), signals other positive rewards, and builds self-efficacy.

### Strategy 5: Be Fair in Allocating Rewards

People will lost motivation if they feel they have been treated unfairly. 2 key types of justice:

- **Distributive Justice** -- are my outcomes fair?
- **Procedural Justice** -- was the process fair?

How do we determine if our outcomes are fair?

Adams' _Equity Theory_ says that we compare our input and outcome ratio to "relevant others".

What is an Equitable Salary?

- **External Equity** - Market Pay: what are employees in other companies paid for doing my job?
- **Internal Equity** - Within Company Pay: what are employees in my organization paid for doing my job?

When there is an active job market for talent, external equity wins the day. Pay secrecy policies are used to minimize easy comparisons... but they often don't work and are perceived as signals of inequity.

### Strategy 6: Use a Fair Process

Even if people don't like the outcomes, perceptions of procedural justice matter.

- The procedures used in making the decisions are FAIR (consistency, accuracy, ethicality, lack of bias)
- They had a VOICE in the process
- Mistakes are CORRECTABLE (by a grievance process)

> There is more hunger for appreciation in this world than there is for bread. --- Mother Theresa

## 8 Designing Engaging Work Places

One of the ways managers influence employee motivation is through designing work places that encourage engagement. We'll begin with a discussion of engagement, and why so many companies are intent on increasing it. Then we break it down by discussing ways of designing jobs to make them more intrinsically interesting to employees. Techniques such as job enrichment, job enlargement, and job crafting will be covered. In addition, we cover the topic of delegation to increase feelings of employee empowerment. Finally, we discuss the important balance between engagement and burnout. The goal is to help you design a work place that encourages engaged employees who bring their whole selves to work, are motivated to accomplish organizational objectives, and who thrive rather than burnout in the process.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Understand the key factors leading to employee engagement and burnout.
- Design jobs that are more intrinsically interesting to employees.
- Know when, why and how to delegate for maximum effectiveness and empowerment.

## 8.1 Intrinsic Motivation & Job Design

> Most people aren't anywhere near to realizing their creative potential, in part because they are laboring in environments that impede intrinsic motivation. --- Prof. Teresa Amabile

### Intrinsic Motivation

A person engages in behavior because it is personally rewarding.

It reflects passion for particular activities, but can also be influenced by managers through:

- Goal accomplishment
- A meaningful purpose
- Choice over process
- Feedback on performance

### When Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations Collide

performance can decrease with increased rewards. The _over-justification effect_ occurs when offering excessive external rewards for a task that is already intrinsically interesting, reduces motivation.

### Extrinsic Rewards Can Be Good For

- Motivating tasks where is little initial interest
- Motivating skill development
- Providing external feedback on performance
- Praise (external recognition) can increase internal motivation by building _self-efficacy_ (confidence in capability to perform)

### Extrinsic Rewards Can Undermine Intrinsic Motivation When

- They are awarded for minimal work.
- They become expected.
- They are handed out freely, with little regard to performance.

### Design Intrinsically Interesting Jobs

- Managers can influence the motivating level of a job by influencing core characteristics of the job.
- Hackman & Oldham’s _Theory of Job Design_ provides 5 ways to change jobs, influence psychological states and impact performance.

### Theory of Job Design

- Core Job Characteristics
  - Skill variety
  - Task identity
  - Task significance
  - Autonomy
  - Feedback
- Psychological States
  - Meaningfulness
  - Responsibility
  - Knowledge of results
- Outcomes
  - Motivation
  - Performance
  - Satisfaction
  - Absenteeism
  - Turnover

### Job Characteristics

- **Skill variety** – increase the number of different activities, skills & talents used
- **Task identity** – expand the job to cover a task from beginning to end
- **Task significance** – emphasize the job’s impact on the lives or work of others
- **Autonomy** – increase the degree of discretion in scheduling work & determining procedures
- **Feedback** from the _job_ – increase the degree to which performing the job provides direct & clear information on effectiveness.

### Employee Engagement

The Immersion of self into work roles, employing and expressing physical, mental and emotional energy for work.

Job demands are typically _inversely_ related to engagement, but if demands are viewed as _challenges_, the relationship reverses.

### 3 Keys to Engagement

- _Meaning_ - "What I do matters to others and the world"
- _Support_ - "Freedom to be who I am and can take risks to try things"
- _Competence_ - "I know what I'm doing and can do it well, or can find resources to improve"

### How can you raise your own level of engagement

A recent "diary study" of 187 individuals in different industries and organizations, results found that people use of time management had a strong relationship with daily engagement & productivity.

- Night before planning of next day.
- Create boundaries around time to prevent interruptions.
- If few anticipated interruptions, set ambitious to-do-list
- If several anticipated interruptions, set contingency plans.

> The best moments in our lives are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times... The best moments usually occur if a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. --- Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

---

## 8.2 Empowered Delegation

> Surround yourself with the best people you can find, delegate authority, and don't interfere as long as the policy you've decided upon is being carried out. --- Ronald Reagan

### What is Delegation

Definition: The assignment of authority to another person to carry out specific job-related activities.

The inability to delegate has led to the downfall of many executives.

- _Vertical delegation_ - requires active coaching and knowing your people's skill sets.
- _Horizontal delegation_ - requires influence skills and political savvy.

Delegation is NOT:

- (Just) A way to get more work done
- Simply assigning tasks to someone
- A test to see whether someone is capable
- Abdicating responsibility or accountability for the final results.

**Delegation IS**: A way to get the work done and empower and develop others.

Empowered individuals should experience the following:

- Self-efficacy - I have confidence in my capability to perform activities
- Impact - I believe it is possible to have a significant impact on the job and work environment.
- Meaningfulness - I value the purpose of what I'm doing.
- Trust - I feel secure enough to take risks.

### Not Everything is Appropriate to Delegate

Inappropriate items for delegation generally include:

- Complaints from employees or customers regarding another employee
- Allegations of professional or personal misconduct
- Distribution of bonus money or rewards
- Notification that someone has received a job offer from a competitor, is intending to leave the company, has requested a transfer, etc.
- Strategic decisions regarding allocation of resources.

### 5 Steps for Effective Delegation

1. Analyze the task -- is appropriate?
2. Select the right person: (1) Understand current capabilities; (2) Know how to stretch a person but _not break_ them.
3. Assign the task
4. Allow them to execute the task
5. Conduct regular feedback sessions to monitor and evaluate progress.

> A leader is great, not because of his or her power, but because of his or her ability to empower others. --- John C. Maxwell

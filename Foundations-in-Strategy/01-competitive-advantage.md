A firm's resources and capabilities can produce a sustained competitive advantage by creating value for customers by

- lowering costs, or

Types of Recourses and Capabilities:

  - Plant and equipment
  - Access to raw materials
  - Locations
- Financial
  - Cash
  - Ability to borrow
  - Ability to generate cash flow

  - Systems and processes for controlling and coordinating
- Intangible
  - Brand, image, reputation
  - Organizational culture
  - Employment brand
  - Intellectual properties

### VISOR Criteria

To give a firm a sustainable competitive advantage, a resource or capability must be:

- Valuable (i.e., must create value)
- Expensive to imitate or difficult to Imitate
- No Substitutes exist
- The firm is Organized to leverage the resource. (e.g., org.structure, compensation, culture)
- Rare among competitors

#### What makes imitation difficult?

- Path dependence

  A resource or capability arises from a series of unique decisions.

- Causal ambiguity

  We cannot identify clearly what caused the development of unique resources and capabilities.

- Social complexity

  A resource or capability resides in complex relationships among systems, departments, and people.

- A firm must perform different activities from the competition or similar activities in different ways.
- Competitive advantage comes from the way that activities fit together and reinforce each other.

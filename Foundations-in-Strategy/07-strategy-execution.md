# Strategy Execution

In this module, we turn from strategic analysis and strategy formulation to the execution of strategy. Strategy is worth nothing without effective execution.

Of course, strategy execution is not simple. It requires managers to allocate and deploy resources effectively across multiple departments and/or business units, to coordinate activities, to monitor performance, and to adjust course when needed.

Superior strategy execution requires a system that integrates planning, operations, and performance reporting. The balanced scorecard tool is one such system.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Describe the balance scorecard and explain why it is useful.
- Design, implement, and asses a strategy using the balanced scorecard.

## Translating Vision and Strategy: Four Perspectives

- Financial
- Customer
- Process
- Learning & Growth

## What is a Balanced Scorecard used for?

1. Articulate the strategy of the business
1. To communicate the strategy of the business
1. To help align individual, organizational, and cross-departmental initiatives to achieve a common goal

## How to Construct a Balanced Scorecard

1. Identify a strategy
1. Identify a financial goal
1. Identify a customer segment
1. Identify relevant processes
1. Identify learning & growth initiatives

A strategy map organizes:

- Cause-and-effect relationships
- Causal paths from all measures should lead directly or indirectly to financial performance

The dashboard organizes:

- Objectives
- Measures (lead indicators)
- Targets (lag indicators)
- Initiatives

## The Balanced Scorecard

Combines:

- Financial metrics
- Non-financial metrics

The Pros

- Balance between short-term and long-term objectives
- Encourages conscious monitoring of
  - strategic objectives
  - lead indicators (performance drivers)
  - lag indicators (outcome measures)

The Cons

- The multiplicity of measures can seem confusing

How to Overcome the Confusion?

- Fit between strategy and objectives
- Alignment between objectives and metrics

## The Financial Perspective

Define the long-run objectives of the business unit

- Rapid growth: sales growth emphasis
- Sustain: profitability emphasis
- Harvest: cash flow maximization emphasis

## The Customer Perspective

Customer-oriented measures:

- Identify the target customer segment
- Measure the business unit's performance in the target market segment
  - Market share
  - Customer satisfaction
  - Customer retention
  - New customer acquisition
  - Customer profitability

## The Process Perspective

Process measures:

- Identify the processes in which the organization must excel
- Processes must allow the organization to:
  1. Deliver on value proposition to customers in the target market
  1. Satisfy shareholder expectations of financial returns

## The Learning & Growth Perspective

Learning & Growth measures:

- Identify the infrastructure necessary to create long-term growth and improvement
- Organizational learning arises from investments in:
  1. People
  1. Systems
  1. Organizational procedures

## Wrap-Up and Takeaways

- Balanced Scorecard approach enables managers to test the theory of the business strategy
- Balanced Scorecard approach often uncovers gaps in between existing capabilities and strategic goals
- Success is ultimately determined by financial results

## Balanced Scorecard

A balanced scorecard augments traditional financial measures with benchmarks for performance in three key non-financial areas:

- a company's relationship with its customers
- its key internal processes
- its learning and growth

The balanced scorecard relies on four processes to bind short-term activities to long-term objectives:

1. Translating the vision

   By relying on measurement, the scorecard forces managers to come to agreement on the metrics they will use to operationalize their lofty visions.

1. Communicating and linking

   When a scorecard is disseminated up and down the organizational chart, strategy becomes a tool available to everyone. As the high-level scorecard cascades down to individual business units, overarching strategic objectives and measures are translated into objectives and measures appropriate to each particular group. Tying these targets to individual performance and compensation systems yields "personal scorecards." Thus, individual employees understand how their own productivity supports the overall strategy.

1. Business planning

   Most companies have separate procedures (and sometimes units) for strategic planning and budgeting. Little wonder, then, that typical long-term planning is, in the words of one executive, where "the rubber meets the sky." The discipline of creating a balanced scorecard forces companies to integrate the two functions, thereby ensuring that financial budgets do indeed support strategic goals. After agreeing on performance measures for the four scorecard perspectives, companies identify the most influential "drivers" of the desired outcomes and then set milestones for gauging the progress they make with these drivers.

1. Feedback and learning

   By supplying a mechanism for strategic feedback and review, the balanced scorecard helps an organization foster a kind of learning often missing in companies: the ability to reflect on inferences and adjust theories about cause-and-effect relationships.

   Feedback about products and services. New learning about key internal processes. Technological discoveries. All this information can be fed into the scorecard, enabling strategic refinements to be made continually. Thus at any point in the implementation, managers can know whether the strategy is working -- and if not, why.

# Five Forces

If the forces are intense, almost no company earns attractive returns on investment. If the forces are benign, many companies are profitable.

Industry structure drives competition and profitability. Industry structure, manifested in the competitive forces, sets industry profitability in the medium and long run.

## Threat of entry

New entrants to an industry bring new capacity and a desire to gain market share that puts pressure on prices, costs, and the rate of investment necessary to compete.

The threat of entry puts a cap on the profit potential of an industry. When the threat is high, incumbents must hold down their prices or boost investment to deter new competitors.

The threat of entry in an industry depends on the height of entry barriers that are present and on the reaction entrants can expect from incumbents. It is the _threat_ of entry, not whether entry actually occurs, that holds down profitability.

### Barriers to entry

Entry barriers are advantages that incumbents have relative to new entrants. There are seven major sources:

1. Supply-side economies of scale.

   These economies arise when firms that produces at larger volumes enjoy lower costs per unit because they can spread fixed costs over more units, employ more efficient technology, or command better terms from suppliers.

1. Demand-side benefits of scale.

   These benefits, also known as network effects, arise in industries where a buyer's willingness to pay for a company's product increases with the number of other buyers who also patronize the company. Buyers may trust larger companies more for a crucial product.

1. Customer switching costs.

   Switching costs are fixed costs that buyers face when they change suppliers.

1. Capital requirements.

   The need to invest large financial resources in order to compete can deter new entrants. Capital may be necessary not only for fixed facilities but also to extend customer credit, build inventories, and fund start-up losses.

1. Incumbency advantages independent of size.

   No matter what their size, incumbents may have cost or quality advantages not available to potential rivals. These advantages can stem from such sources as proprietary technology, preferential access to the best raw material sources, preemption of the most favorable geographic locations, established brand identities, or cumulative experience that has allowed incumbents to learn how to produce more efficiently.

1. Unequal access to distribution channels.

   The new entrant must secure distribution of its product or service.

1. Restrictive government policy.

   Government policy can heighten other entry barriers through such means as expansive patenting rules that protect proprietary technology from imitation or environmental or safety regulations that raise scale economies facing newcomers. Of course, government policies may also make entry easier through subsidies.

### Expected retaliation

How potential entrants believe incumbents may react will also influence their decision to enter or stay out of an industry. Newcomers are likely to fear expected retaliation if:

- Incumbents have previously responded vigorously to new entrants.
- Incumbents possess substantial resources to fight back, including excess cash and unused borrowing power, available productive capacity, or clout with distribution channels and customers.
- Incumbents seem likely to cut prices because they are committed to retaining market share at all costs or because the industry has high fixed costs, which create a strong motivation to drop prices to fill excess capacity.
- Industry growth is slow so newcomers can gain volume only by taking it from incumbents.

## The power of suppliers

Powerful suppliers capture more of the value for themselves by charging higher prices, limiting quality or services, or shifting costs to industry participants.

A suppliers group is powerful if:

- It is more concentrated than the industry it sells to.
- The supplier group does not depend heavily on the industry for its revenues.
- Industry participants face switching costs in changing suppliers.
- Suppliers offer products that are differentiated.
- There is no substitute for what the supplier group provides.
- The supplier group can credibly threaten to integrate forward into the industry.

---

## The power of buyers

Powerful customers can capture more value by forcing down prices, demanding better quality or more service, and generally playing industry participants off against one another, all at the expense of industry profitability. Buyers are powerful if they have negotiating leverage relative to industry participants, especially if they are price sensitive, using their clout primarily to pressure price reductions.

A customer group has negotiating leverage if:

- There are few buyers, or each one purchases in volumes that are large relative to the size of a single vendor. Large-volume buyers are particularly powerful in industries with high fixed costs. High fixed costs and low marginal costs amplify the pressure on rivals to keep capacity filled through discounting.
- The industry's products are standardized or undifferentiated.
- Buyers face few switching costs in changing vendors.
- Buyers can credibly threaten to integrate backward and produce the industry's product themselves if vendors are too profitable.

A buyer group is price sensitive if:

- The product it purchases from the industry represents a significant fraction of its cost structure or procurement budget.
- Thy buyer group earns low profits, is strapped for cash, or is otherwise under pressure to trim its purchasing costs.
- The quality of buyers' products or services is little affected by the industry's product.
- The industry's product has little effect on the buyer's other costs.

## The threat of substitutes

A substitute performs the same or a similar function as an industry's product by a different means. When the threat of substitutes is high, industry profitability suffers. Substitute products or services limit an industry's profit potential by placing a ceiling on prices. If an industry does not distance itself from substitutes through product performance, marketing, or other means, it will suffer in terms of profitability -- and often growth potential.

The threat of a substitute is high if:

- It offers an attractive price-performance trade-off to the industry's product. The better the relative value of the substitute, the tighter is the lid on an industry's profit potential.
- The buyer's cost of switching to the substitute is low.

## Rivalry among existing competitors

Rivalry among existing competitors takes many familiar forms, including price discounting, new product introductions, advertising compaigns, and service improvements.

The intensity of rivalry is greatest if:

- Competitors are numerous or are roughly equal in size and power.
- Industry growth is slow.
- Exit barriers are high.
- Rivals are highly committed to the business and have aspirations for leadership, especially if they have goals that go beyond economic performance in the particular industry.
- Firms cannot read each other's signals well because of lack of familiarity with one another, diverse approaches to competing, or differing goals.

Price competition is most liable to occur if:

- Products or services of rivals are nearly identical and there are few switching costs for buyers.
- Fixed costs are high and marginal costs are low.
- Capacity must be expanded in large increments to be efficient.
- The product is perishable.

Competitions on dimensions other than price - on product features, support services, delivery time, or brand image, for instance - is less likely to erode profitability because it improves customer value and can support higher prices. Also, rivalry focused on such dimensions can improve values relative to substitutes or raise the barriers facing new entrants.

Rivalry can be positive sum, or actually increase the average profitability of an industry, when each competitor aims to serve the needs of different customer segments, with different mixes of price, products, services, features, or brand identities.

## Factors

Industry structure, as manifested in the strength of the five competitive forces, determines the industry's long-run profit potential because it determines how the economic value created by the industry is divided.

It is important to avoid the common pitfall of mistaking certain visible attributes of an industry for its underlying structure. Consider the following:

- Industry growth rate.

  Growth does tend to mute rivalry, because an expanding pie offers opportunities for all competitors. But fast growth can put suppliers in a powerful position, and high growth with low entry barriers will draw in entrants. Even without new entrants, a high growth rate will not guarantee profitability if customers are powerful or substitutes are attractive.

- Technology and innovation.

  Advanced technology or innovations are not by themselves enough to make an industry structurally attractive or unattractive.

- Government.

  The best way to understand the influence of government on competition is to analyze how specific government policies affect the five competitive forces.

- Complementary products and services.

  Complements arise when the customer benefit of two products combined is grater than the sum of each product's value in isolation. Complements can be important when they affect the overall demand for an industry's product.

## Changes in Industry Structure

The five competitive forces provide a framework for identifying the most important industry developments and for anticipating their impact on industry attractiveness.

## Implications for Strategy

By understanding how the five competitive forces influence profitability in your industry, you can develop a strategy for enhancing your company's long-term profits. Porter suggests the following:

1. Position Your Company Where the Forces Are Weakest

1. Exploit Changes in the Forces

1. Reshape the Forces in Your Favor

An industry's structure can be reshaped in two ways: (1) by redividing profitability in favor of incumbents, or (2) by expanding the overall profit pool.

Use tactics designed specifically to reduce the share of profits leaking to other players. For example:

- To neutralize **supplier power**, standardize specifications for parts so your company can switch more easily among vendors.
- To counter **customer power**, expand your services so it's harder for customers to leave you for a rival.
- To temper price wars initiated by **established rivals**, invest more heavily in products that differ significantly from competitors' offerings.
- To scare off **new entrants**, elevate the fixed costs of competing; for instance, by escalating your R&D expenditures.
- To limit the threat of **substitutes**, offer better value through wider product accessibility. Soft-drink producers did this by introducing vending machines and convenience store channels, which dramatically improved the availability of soft drinks relative to other beverages.

## Other Concepts

A fragmented industry is one in which many companies compete and there is no single or small group of companies which dominate the industry. The competitive structure of the industry means that no one company is in an overly strong or influential position in the industry.

Market concentration is the distribution of a given market among the participating companies. Market concentration is also known as seller concentration or industry concentration.

Vertical integration is when a company owns or controls its suppliers, distributors or retail locations to control its value or supply chain.

Vertical integration benefits companies by allowing them to control the process, reduce costs and improve efficiencies.

Backward integration is when a company expands backward on the production path into manufacturing.

Forward integration is when companies control the direct distribution or supply of their products.

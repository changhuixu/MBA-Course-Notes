# Balanced Scorecard

## Total Performance

The Total Business Performance indicator is a quantitative measure of the executive team's ability to effectively manage the resources of the firm. It considers both the historical performance of the firm as well as how well the firm is positioned to compete in the future. As such, it measures the action potential of the firm.

The index employs what is called a balanced scorecard to measure the executive team's performance. The most important measure is the team's financial performance, and thus its ability to create wealth for the investors. However, the focus on current profits has caused many executives to stress the present at the expense of the future.

The long-term viability of the firm requires that the executive team be good at managing not only the firm's profitability, but also its marketing activities, production operations, human resources, cash, and financial resources. The management team must also invest in the future. These expenses might depress the current financial performance, but are vital to creating new products, markets, and manufacturing capabilities.

In short, top managers must be good at managing all aspects of the firm. The balanced scorecard puts this perspective into practice. It focuses attention on multiple performance measures, and thus multiple decision areas. None can be ignored or downplayed. The best managers will be strong in all areas measured.

The Total Business Performance measure is computed by multiplying several indicators of business performance. This model underscores the importance of all measures. This is because any strength or weakness will have multiple effects on the final outcome, the Action Potential of the Firm.

The following is a summary of the measure of the firm's Total Business Performance and its key performance indicators. The computational details follow. Note that a negative score in any of these indicators will result in a Total Performance of "0".

```
Primary Segment: Workhorse
Secondary Segment: Innovator
```

```
Total Performance = Financial Performance * Market Performance * Marketing Effectiveness * Investment in Future * Wealth * Human Resource Management * Asset Management * Manufacturing Productivity * Financial Risk

= 264.667 * 0.322 * 0.810 * 3.464 * 1.596 * 0.874 * 1.303 * 0.653 * 0.694
= 197.199

Financial Performance: 264.667
Market Performance: 0.322
Marketing Effectiveness: 0.810
Investment in Future: 3.464
Wealth: 1.596
Human Resource Management: 0.874
Asset Management: 1.303
Manufacturing Productivity: 0.653

```

## Financial Performance

measures how well the executive team has been able to create profits for its shareholders. A positive number is always desired and the larger the better. It is computed in three steps.

First, a measure of the company's profitability is computed by taking the average of your gross profit and your net profit from operations.

The **gross profit** is the company's revenue minus the costs of making your products. It is computed subtracting rebates and the cost of the goods sold from total revenues. Gross profit measures how efficiently you produce revenue.

The **net profit** from operations is computed by taking the operating profit shown in the income statement and adding back investments in the future that are expensed in the current quarter. It measures how well the managers are able to create revenue from the current quarter's marketing, sales and manufacturing activities.

Note that the income statement also includes investments that will benefit your firm's future (referred to as '**Investment in Future**' in the balanced scorecard). Because these expenses will help you to create new business opportunities, they are added back to the operating profit so that the financial performance measure is entirely focused on current quarter revenues and expenses.

Second, the total number of shares of stock is computed by adding all forms of equity investment. If an emergency loan has been taken out, shares of stock will automatically be issued to the loan shark and they become a permanent part of the equity financing.

Third, the average of your gross profit and your net profit from current operations is divided by the number of shares of stock issued to determine the profitability per share of stock.

```
Financial Performance = (Net Profit from Current Operations + Gross Profit ) / 2 / Total Shares Issued

= (19,198,429 + 26,936,756 ) / 2 / 87,157
= 264.67

Net Profit from Current Operations
= Operating Profit + Investments in Firm's Future = 10,742,206 + 8,456,223 = 19,198,429

Operating Profit
= Gross Profit - Total Expenses = 26,936,756 - 16,194,551 = 10,742,206
    Gross Profit: 26,936,756
    Total Expenses: 16,194,551

Investments in Firm's Future
= Cost to Open New Sales Offices and Web Sales Centers + R&D Investment in New Brand Features and New Brands + R&D Licenses + R&D to Improve Changeover + Quality Improvements + Depreciation = 864,745 + 5,405,560 + 0 + 600,000 + 1,316,390 + 269,528 = 8,456,223
    Cost to Open New Sales Offices and Web Sales Centers: 864,745
    R&D Investment in New Brand Features and New Brands: 5,405,560
    R&D Licenses: 0
    R&D to Improve Changeover: 600,000
    Quality Improvements
    = Quality Costs - Warranty Costs = 1,333,025 - 16,635 = 1,316,390
        Quality Costs: 1,333,025
        Warranty Costs: 16,635
    Depreciation: 269,528
    Gross Profit: 26,936,756

Total Shares Issued
= Number of Shares Issued to Executive Team + Number of Shares Issued to Venture Capitalists + Number of Shares Issued to Loan Shark = 40,000 + 46,224 + 933 = 87,157
    Number of Shares Issued to Executive Team: 40,000
    Number of Shares Issued to Venture Capitalists: 46,224
    Number of Shares Issued to Loan Shark: 933
```

## Market Performance

is a measure of how well the managers are able to create demand in their primary and secondary segments. The firm's market share in two target segments is used to measure this demand creation ability. The market share score is adjusted downwards if there were any stock-outs. This penalty for stock-outs is to underscore two points. First, unnecessary resources have been spent to generate more demand than can be satisfied. Second, ill will has been created by having potential customers become frustrated when they do not find the products that they have been persuaded to buy. The score ranges from 0 to 1.0 and will depend upon the number of competitors. If there are 3 firms, a good score would be greater than 0.5. If there are 8 teams, a good score would be greater than 0.35.

```
Market Performance = Average Market Share in Targeted Segments / 100 * Percent of Demand Actually Served / 100

= 35 / 100 * 92 / 100
= 0.32

Average Market Share in Targeted Segments
= ( Market Share in Primary Segment + Market Share in Secondary Segment ) / 2 = ( 42 + 28 ) / 2 = 35
    Market Share in Primary Segment: 42
    Market Share in Secondary Segment: 28
Percent of Demand Actually Served
= ( ( Total Net Demand - Number of Stock-outs ) / Total Net Demand ) * 100 = ( ( 13,973 - 1,105 ) / 13,973 ) * 100 = 92
    Total Net Demand: 13,973
    Number of Stock-outs: 1,105
```

## Marketing Effectiveness

is a measure of how well the managers have been able to satisfy the needs of the customers as measured by the quality of their brands and ads. Customer perceptions of the firm's brands and ads in its primary and secondary segments are used to measure customer satisfaction. The two scores are then averaged to obtain the indicator for marketing effectiveness. The score ranges from 0 to 1.0. A good score would be greater than 0.8.

```
Marketing Effectiveness = ( Average Brand Judgment / 100 + Average Ad Judgment / 100 ) / 2

= ( 86 / 100 + 76 / 100 ) / 2
= 0.81

Average Brand Judgment
= ( Highest Brand Judgment in Primary Segment + Highest Brand Judgment in Secondary Segment ) / 2 = ( 87 + 85 ) / 2 = 86
    Highest Brand Judgment in Primary Segment: 87
    Highest Brand Judgment in Secondary Segment: 85
Average Ad Judgment
= ( Highest Ad Judgment in Primary Segment + Highest Ad Judgment in Secondary Segment ) / 2 = ( 84 + 68 ) / 2 = 76
    Highest Ad Judgment in Primary Segment: 84
    Highest Ad Judgment in Secondary Segment: 68
```

## Investment in Future

reflects the willingness of the executive team to spend current revenues on future business opportunities. They are necessary but risky. In the short-term, these expenditures can cause large negative profits on the income statement. As a result, the retained earnings may become highly negative, thus indicating that a substantial portion of the stockholder's investment has disappeared into the operations of the firm. In the long-term, these investments are absolutely necessary if the firm is to be competitive. Thus, there is a need to balance the loss of stockholder's equity against investments which could create even greater returns for the investors in the future. The score is always greater or equal to 1.0 and a good score would be greater than 3.0.

```
Investment in Future = ( Cumulative Expenses that Benefit Firm's Future / Cumulative Net Revenues ) * 10 + 1

= ( 16,719,907 / 67,843,509 ) * 10 + 1
= 3.46

Cumulative Expenses that Benefit Firm's Future
= Cumulative Cost to Open New Sales Offices and Web Sales Centers + Cumulative R&D Investment in New Brand Features and New Brands + Cumulative R&D Licenses + Cumulative R&D to Improve Changeover + Cumulative Quality Improvements + Cumulative Depreciation = 3,083,057 + 9,767,285 + 0 + 1,582,000 + 1,783,503 + 504,062 = 16,719,907
    Cumulative Cost to Open New Sales Offices and Web Sales Centers: 3,083,057
    Cumulative R&D Investment in New Brand Features and New Brands: 9,767,285
    Cumulative R&D Licenses: 0
    Cumulative R&D to Improve Changeover: 1,582,000
    Cumulative Quality Improvements
    = Cumulative Quality Costs - Cumulative Warranty Costs = 1,941,673 - 158,171 = 1,783,503
        Cumulative Quality Costs: 1,941,673
        Cumulative Warranty Costs: 158,171
    Cumulative Depreciation: 504,062
    Cumulative Net Revenues
    = Cumulative Sales Revenue - Cumulative Rebates = 68,540,259 - 696,750 = 67,843,509
        Cumulative Sales Revenue: 68,540,259
        Cumulative Rebates: 696,750
```

## Wealth

is a measure of how well the executive team has been able to add wealth to the initial investments of the stockholders. During the start-up phase of the company, it is expected that expenses will greatly exceed revenues leading to large losses and retained earnings figures that are largely negative.

To compute the creation of wealth measure, the net equity of the firm is first computed by adding the retained earnings to the total of the investments from all of the stockholders. The retained earnings figure is the sum of all profits from the inception of the firm. As noted above, the retained earnings will be negative in the early quarters as the firm invests money to start up and grow the business.

Next, the net equity is divided by the total of all equity investments to obtain a ratio of wealth creation. A value of zero or less indicates bankruptcy. A value greater than zero and less than one indicates the executive team is relying upon the initial stockholder's investments to pay day-to-day expenses plus invest in the future. A value greater than one indicates the firm is adding wealth to the stockholders.

```
Wealth = Net Equity / Total Stockholders Equity

= 14,366,105 / 8,999,948
= 1.60

Net Equity
= Retained Earnings + Common Stock + Dividends Paid to Date = 5,366,157 + 8,999,948 + 0 = 14,366,105
    Retained Earnings: 5,366,157
    Common Stock: 8,999,948
    Dividends Paid to Date: 0
Total Stockholders Equity
= Common Stock = 8,999,948 = 8,999,948
    Common Stock: 8,999,948
```

## Human Resource Management

is a measure of how well the executive team is able to recruit the best employees, satisfy their needs, and motivate them to excel. Sales force productivity and production worker productivity are averaged together to obtain a single score. High performance is only possible if the firm's compensation packages are competitive and in tune with what is important to employees over time. The scores range from zero to 1.00 and a good score would be greater than 0.80.

```
Human Resource Management = ( Sales Force Productivity / 100 + Production Worker Productivity / 100 ) / 2

= ( 82 / 100 + 93 / 100 ) / 2
= 0.87

Sales Force Productivity: 82
Production Worker Productivity: 93
```

## Asset Management

is a measure of the executive team's ability to use the firm's assets to create sales revenue. The first step in measuring asset management is to compute the asset turnover of the firm. Effective managers are able to use the assets to create sales which are two or three times the value of the assets. Thus, a very good score would be 3.0.

In addition to asset turnover, ending inventories are also measured and included. To avoid stock-outs, and their associated penalties, managers might be inclined to build excessive inventory. To discourage large ending inventories, there is a penalty for producing more inventory than is needed to meet demand. The penalty increases as the proportion of ending inventory to production increases.

Note that a negative penalty for excess inventory will result in an Asset Management of "0".

```
Asset Management = Asset Turnover * Penalty for Excess Inventory

= 1.46 * 0.89
= 1.30

Asset Turnover
= Net Revenues / Total Assets = 43,581,897 / 29,840,392 = 1.46
    Net Revenues
    = Sales Revenue - Rebates + Interest Income = 44,006,893 - 441,350 + 16,354
    = 43,581,897
        Sales Revenue: 44,006,893
        Rebates: 441,350
        Interest Income: 16,354
    Total Assets: 29,840,392

Penalty for Excess Inventory
= 1 - Ending Inventory / Production = 1 - 1,554 / 14,422 = 0.89
    Ending Inventory: 1,554
    Production: 14,422
```

## Manufacturing Productivity

measures the executive team's ability to efficiently create reliable products. Reliable products are a high priority of all customers and thus it is the first measure of manufacturing productivity. To achieve a reliable manufacturing process, the managers will have to invest money to study and then improve upon the production processes. It is a multi-step process which takes time and considerable resources.

The second measure of productivity focuses on how much of the operating capacity is actually used in production versus that portion lost to changeover or excess capacity. Changeover can be improved by making investments which improve procedures, equipment and materials needed to switch from one component to the next. Excess capacity costs occur when the production facility is scheduled to produce more units than is needed to meet demand or stock the warehouse. Good forecasting and production scheduling will reduce penalties for excess capacity.

The score ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. A very good score would be 0.80.

```
Manufacturing Productivity = ( Reliability Judgment / 100 ) * ( Percent of Operating Capacity Used in Production / 100 )

= ( 73 / 100 ) * ( 89 / 100 )
= 0.65

Reliability Judgment: 73

Percent of Operating Capacity Used in Production
= ( Total Effective Operating Capacity Used / Operating Capacity Scheduled ) * 100
= ( 14,422 / 16,120 ) * 100 = 89
    Total Effective Operating Capacity Used: 14,422
    Operating Capacity Scheduled: 16,120
```

## Financial Risk

measures the executive team's ability to manage debt as a financial resource. The financial risk indicator is based upon the degree to which debt is part of the capital of the firm. As debt increases relative to the total capital, then the financial risk associated with the company increases. Conversely, as the proportion of equity in the total capital increases, then the perceived financial risk in the firm decreases.

To compute financial risk, the proportion of equity is obtained by computing the amount of equity in the firm and dividing it by the amount of capital invested in the firm from all sources. Specifically, the amount of equity is equal to the sum of common stock plus retained earnings. The amount of capital is equal to the sum of debt plus common stock plus retained earnings. As the ratio of equity to capital decreases (meaning more debt), then financial risk increases.

A value of 1.00 would indicate there is no debt and, therefore, no perceived financial risk.

It is important to realize that financial managers do not want to totally discourage debt. The optimum capital structure will vary by firm depending on its tax situation, overall risk, asset base, and financial slack. Some debt may be desirable in order to help the firm take advantage of value enhancing business opportunities (i.e., opportunities that earn more than the company's weighted average cost of capital).

In order to mitigate or downplay the effect of low amounts of debt in the capital structure, the value for the share of equity in the company is raised to a power of 0.5 (square root). Thus, if debt represented 20% of the capital structure, then the Financial risk indicator would be 0.89 (0.80 ^ 0.5). If debt were 50% of the capital structure, the Financial Risk indicator would be 0.71.

A Financial Risk indicator below 0.80 (more than 36% debt) would be considered unfavorable.

```
Financial Risk = ( Total Equity / Total Capital ) ^ 0.5

= ( 14,366,105 / 29,840,392 ) ^ 0.5
= 0.69

Total Equity
= Common Stock + Retained Earnings = 8,999,948 + 5,366,157 = 14,366,105
    Common Stock: 8,999,948
    Retained Earnings: 5,366,157
Total Capital
= Common Stock + Retained Earnings + Debt = 8,999,948 + 5,366,157 + 15,474,287 = 29,840,392
    Common Stock: 8,999,948
    Retained Earnings: 5,366,157
    Debt: 15,474,287
```

## Target and Replenishment Point

The target inventory represents the maximum inventory to be stored in the production facility warehouse.

The replenishment point is the trigger or signal to the production manager that the brand inventory is dangerously low and could soon result in a stock-out.

The production priority is a signal to the production manager to favor one brand over another in a situation where two brands have fallen below the replenishment point and only one brand can be produced.

## Price Skimming

Price skimming is a product pricing strategy by which a firm charges the highest initial price that customers will pay and then lowers it over time. As the demand of the first customers is satisfied and competition enters the market, the firm lowers the price to attract another, more price-sensitive segment of the population.

## Penetration Pricing

Penetration pricing is a marketing strategy used by businesses to attract customers to a new product or service by offering a lower price during its initial offering. The lower price helps a new product or service penetrate the market and attract customers away from competitors. Market penetration pricing relies on the strategy of using low prices initially to make a wide number of customers aware of a new product.

The goal of a price penetration strategy is to entice customers to try a new product and build market share with the hope of keeping the new customers once prices rise back to normal levels. Penetration pricing examples include an online news website offering one month free for a subscription-based service or a bank offering a free checking account for six months.

# Difference Between Vision and Mission Statements

Definition of vision and mission: A **vision statement** focuses on tomorrow and what an organization wants to ultimately become. A **mission statement** focuses on today and what an organization does to achieve it. Both are vital in directing goals.

## What is a mission statement?

Your mission statement drives the company. It is what you do/the core of the business, and from it come the objectives and finally, what it takes to reach those objectives. It also shapes your company’s culture.

Mission statement questions look like:

- What do we do?
- Whom do we serve?
- How do we serve them?

A solid mission motivates a team to advance toward a common goal, because they started at the same place and they are working together to reach the same end-goal.

## What is a vision statement?

Your vision statement gives the company direction. It is the future of the business, which then provides the purpose. The vision statement is about what you want to become. It’s aspirational.

Vision statement questions look like:

- What are our hopes and dreams?
- What problem are we solving for the greater good?
- Who and what are we inspiring to change?

The vision statement promotes growth, both internally and externally. A strong vision helps teams focus on what matters the most for their company. It also invites innovation. A purpose-driven company envisions success as a whole, because they know what success means for their company.

# Module 1: Overview of Functions of Effective Leadership

In this short introductory module, we will explore what it means to be an effective leader. What do effective leaders do? What do they accomplish? I will also encourage you to think about how the ideas that we will discuss in this class apply to you by identifying a leadership challenge that you are currently facing.

## Objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Describe the functions of effective leadership.
- Identify a leadership challenge that is currently facing you.

## What is Leadership

> READ The Leadership Challenge, Introduction and Chapter 1

The _Leadership Challenge_ identifies five behaviors that leaders exhibit to make extraordinary things happen. These behaviors were derived from the authors' interviews with a variety of leaders who responded to the question, "What did you do when you were at your personal best as a leader?" As you read Chapter 1, pay attention to the two leaders who are profiled - Brian Alink and Anna Blackburn. How are their leadership styles similar? How do they differ?

> READ The 6 Fundamental Skills Every Offer Should Practice

As you read this short article on leadership, notice which of the 6 fundamental skills that every leader should practice overlap with Kouzes and Posner's five practices of exemplary leadership. What skills does this article include that are not a part of the five practices from The Leadership Challenge?

### Definition Comparison

- **Leadership** is a process whereby an individual influences others to achieve a common goal.

- **Leadership** is ultimately about creating a way for people to contribute to making something extraordinary happen. -- Alan Keith, Lucas Digital

### The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership

- Model the way

  Setting a positive example; get your hands dirty. Model the behavior that you expect of others. This requires you to clarify and give voice to your own values. But it is not just about your values. Leaders must affirm the shared values of the group.

- Inspire a shared vision

  Exciting and ennobling possibilities; clear image. You can't command commitment; you must inspire it. Appeal to shared aspirations.

- Challenge the Process

  Leaders change the status quo. They need input to do that. They search for opportunities and look outward for innovative ways to improve. Experiment, take risks, and learn from mistakes.

- Enable others to act

  Collaboration requires trusting relationships. Empower others. Build their confidence.

- Encourage the heart

  Challenging the status quo and taking responsibility at work is difficult. People may want to give up. Good leaders encourage others by showing that they care and that they value others' contributions. Recognize individuals and teams.

These practices make a positive difference in the engagement and performance of people and organizations.

### The Six Fundamental Skills Every Leader Should Practice

- Shape a vision that is exciting and challenging for your team (or division/unit/organization).
- Translate that vision into a clear strategy about what actions to take, and what not to do.
- Recruit, develop, and reward a team of great people to carry out the strategy.
- Focus on measurable results.
- Foster innovation and learning to sustain your team (or organization) and grow new leaders.
- Lead yourself --- know yourself, improve yourself, and manage the appropriate balance in your own life.

No matter where you are in your career, you can find opportunities to practice these six skills. You'll have varying degrees of success, which is normal.

# Overview of Self-Leadership

In this module, you will start to think about yourself as a leader. Self-awareness is at the core of effective leadership. Self-awareness includes both understanding how others view you and how you view yourself as a leader. Building self-awareness requires being receptive to feedback. Because of this, I have divided this module into three sections:

- Credibility - We will discuss credibility as a key assessment that others make of their leaders. Leaders need to be aware of whether those around them see them as credible. In this section of the module, we will explore how you can build credibility with others and how you can be seen as someone who "walks the talk."
- Leadership Self-Efficacy - Leadership self-efficacy represents leaders' own view of themselves as leaders. This section of the module will help increase your awareness of how you see your own strengths and weaknesses. You will explore how confident you are about your ability to lead effectively.
- Receptiveness to Feedback - Feedback is a key mechanism for building self awareness. Thus, we will conclude this module with strategies for becoming more receptive to feedback that will help you become a more effective leader.

## Objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Explain how leaders build credibility through clarifying values and setting an example.
- Evaluate the consistency between your values and your actions.
- Explain how your leadership self-efficacy may influence your effectiveness as a leader.
- Create a strategy to improve your receptiveness to feedback.

## Credibility

Chapter 2 in _The Leadership Challenge_ is titled, "Credibility is the Foundation of Leadership." I agree with this statement. In order to achieve your goals as a leader, others must see you as credible. As Kouzes and Posner observe, "If you don't believe in the messenger, you won't believe the message." In this section of the module, you'll learn how you can build credibility with those around you.

This section of the module will cover two learning objectives:

- Explain how leaders build credibility through clarifying values and setting an example.
- Evaluate the consistency between your values and your actions.

> READ The Leadership Challenge, Chapters 2-4

In Chapter 2 of _The Leadership Challenge_, Kouzes and Posner share data about the characteristics of admired leaders. Based on this data, they conclude that credibility is the foundation of exemplary leadership. One way to build credibility is through the first practice in _The Leadership Challenge_ - Modeling the Way. When leaders clarify core values and set the example, they are likely to build credibility with others and create a sense of shared purpose and community in their units. Chapters 3 and 4 in _The Leadership Challenge_ provide specific ideas about how to clarify values and set the example.

### Explain how leaders build credibility

**Credibility** The quality of being trusted and believed in.

**Trust** Willingness to be vulnerable to the actions of another.

**Trustworthiness** ability, benevolence, integrity

- Ability - Are you good at what you do?
- Benevolence - Are you looking out for my best interests?
- Integrity - Do you do what you say you will do?

### Model the Way

1. Be clear about your personal values.

   - Terminal values
   - Instrumental values

1. Affirm shared values.
1. Set the example.
1. Teach others to model the values.

## Leadership Self-Efficacy

In addition to understanding whether others view you as a credible leader, it is important to reflect on how you view yourself as a leader. One way to do this is to consider your leadership self-efficacy. **Leadership self-efficacy** is the confidence that you have in yourself to lead effectively.

In this section of the module, we'll focus on this learning objective:

Explain how your leadership self-efficacy may influence your effectiveness as a leader.

### Leadership self-efficacy influences effectiveness

> Challenging Experiences --> Engagement --> Transformational Leadership

But if leaders have low leadership self-efficacy...

> Challenging Experiences --> Burnout --> Laissez-Faire Leadership

### Increasing leadership self-efficacy

- Performance outcomes
- Vicarious experiences
- Verbal persuasion
- Physiological feedback

## Receptiveness to Feedback

At its heart, self-awareness requires that you understand how you impact others. You may think that you are inspiring or that your directions are clear, but you are not an effective leader unless others find you inspiring or clear. Because of this, building self-awareness requires being receptive to feedback from others. In this part of the module, we will explore why it is sometimes difficult to receive feedback, and we will identify some strategies to get the feedback that we need.

In this section of the module, we will cover this objective:

- Create a strategy to improve your receptiveness to feedback.

As leaders, we need to take responsibility for getting the feedback that we need. We also need to be aware of the reasons we may not always be receptive to feedback. One of my favorite books about receiving feedback is _Thanks for the Feedback: The Science and Art of Receiving Feedback Well_ by Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen. In this book, the authors identify three triggers that cause us to block feedback from others.

While it is important to know why we may not always be receptive to feedback, it is even more important to be a proactive seeker of feedback. When you ask for feedback, you need to do so strategically so that you get the feedback that you really need. This short article provides some specific tips for getting the feedback you need.

### How to ask for feedback that helps you get ahead

- Understand what you are looking for
- Ask for feedback in real time
- Pose specific questions
- Press for examples
- Turn to colleagues
- On virtual teams, ask more frequently

Principles to Remember:

**DO:**

- Understand the kind of feedback you want, whether it's coaching, praise, or an evaluation of recent work.
- Ask in real time. This will create a more organic feedback loop going forward.
- Pose specific questions designed to elicit helpful information and examples.

**Don't:**

- Just ask your boss for feedback. Ask colleagues, junior staff, and clients as well.
- Think you have to schedule a formal meeting. You can have brief, informal coaching moments after meetings, in the elevator, and over coffee.
- Rely on email when you are on a virtual team. Pick up the phone.

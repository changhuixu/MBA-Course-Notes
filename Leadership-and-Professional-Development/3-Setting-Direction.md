# Overview of Setting Direction

One major role of a leader is to set direction for their group or organization. Given that the definition of leadership is a process whereby an individual influences others to achieve a common goal, ensuring that everyone is aligned behind a shared goal is a key to effective leadership.

Two of the practices of exemplary leadership from _The Leadership Challenge_ help leaders with the process of setting direction. By inspiring a shared vision, leaders get others united behind an ideal picture of the future. Strategic objectives are aligned with the vision. By emphasizing shared values and expressing emotions, leaders engage others in achieving the vision.

To set direction that moves a group or organization forward, leaders must challenge the process. Leaders must be innovative. They must identify opportunities and take risks to move the organization forward. The process of design thinking provides strategies to help leaders effectively challenge the process.

## Inspire a Shared Vision

Chapters 5 and 6 in _The Leadership Challenge_ describe how leaders can inspire a shared vision. In this section of the module, we will integrate the ideas from those two chapters with best practices on developing missions, visions, and strategic objectives to provide guidance on how leaders can effectively set direction. We will also consider how to engage others in achieving a shared vision by using emotions, communicating authentically, leveraging shared values, and creating a line of sight between personal and team purpose and organizational vision.

> READ The Leadership Challenge, Chapters 5-6

In Chapter 5 of _The Leadership Challenge_, Kouzes and Posner share strategies for imagining possibilities and finding a common purpose with the goal of creating a compelling picture of the future for their group or organization. In Chapter 6 of _The Leadership Challenge_, the focus shifts to enlisting others to strive for the vision by appealing to common ideals and animating the vision. As you read these chapters, make a list of these strategies. Which ones will come naturally to you? Which ones will prove challenging?

## Challenge the Process

The third practice of extraordinary leaders is challenging the process. If a vision is truly revolutionary, pushing the organization far beyond the status quo into the future, then the organization will not be able to achieve the vision through "business-as-usual" practices. Because of this, effective leaders challenge the process. They are constantly on the lookout for new opportunities and new ways of doing things. They realize that being innovative requires experimenting and taking risks.

This section of the module will cover two learning objectives:

# Overview of Leading Individuals and Teams

Once leaders set a direction, they must engage others in the work of achieving the vision. Often leaders are responsible both for motivating individual employees and coordinating the work of teams. In this module, we will discuss a range of strategies for leading individuals and teams.

Two of the practices of exemplary leadership from _The Leadership Challenge_ relate directly to engaging individuals and teams. By enabling others to act, leaders empower individuals, enhancing their self-determination and helping them to develop competence and confidence. They also foster collaboration by creating a climate of trust and facilitating positive work relationships. By encouraging the heart, leaders recognize the contributions of both individuals and teams. They use rewards to reinforce shared values and to create a spirit of community.

In this module, we will incorporate and build on the ideas from _The Leadership Challenge_ in creating strategies to lead individuals and teams. First, we will discuss the strategies that empowering leaders use to engage individuals and teams. These strategies align with the practices of enabling others to act and encouraging the heart as described in _The Leadership Challenge_. We will also discuss the strategies that inclusive leaders use to ensure that their teams are able to leverage diverse ideas to maximize effectiveness. Finally, we will recognize that leaders often have to manage conflict and have difficult conversations as they are leading individuals and teams. I will encourage you not to avoid these difficult conversations and will provide strategies for approaching them that will help you directly address the problem while also maintaining the relationship.

## Objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Describe how empowering leaders engage others.
- Describe how inclusive leaders engage others.
- Evaluate your current competencies in empowering leadership and inclusive leadership.
- Develop a plan for conducting difficult conversations when conflict arises.

## Empowering Leadership

**Empowering leaders** share responsibility and authority with those around them. But they also realize that sharing responsibility and authority alone is not a recipe for success. Empowering leaders must also equip those around them so that they are prepared to take on responsibilities, and they must provide feedback to build competence and confidence in others.

In this part of the module, we consider how enabling others to act and encouraging the heart help leaders empower others. I also share some of my own strategies for effectively empowering others and provide insights into how empowering leaders bring out the best in individuals and teams.

**Empowerment**: The granting of the power, right, or authority to perform various acts or duties.

## Inclusive Leadership

Another important leadership skill for leading individuals and teams is inclusive leadership. Inclusive leaders create relationships and climates in which people feel respected, understood, and valued. As a result, organizations can more effectively leverage the potential of a diverse workforce.

**Inclusive Leadership** is about creating those environments that allow everyone to contribute and are able to take advantage of the potential that a diverse workforce brings.

The goal of inclusive leaders is two fold. (1) It’s about creating a place where people feel that they belong. Belongingness is a basic human need. When employees feel a bond with the organization, and when they feel they belong to a team, they are much more connected and committed to that organization. (2) Inclusive leadership also helps to achieve the goal of contribution. When we create systems within organizations that welcome different perspectives and take those into account in decision making, we are enabling employees to make contributions. So inclusive leaders are trying to satisfy this need for belonging and provide this opportunity for contribution, which makes for a better workplace for the employees, and more effective outcomes for the organization.

What inclusive leaders do to create those environments? – Four specific strategies.

1. Inclusive leaders treat everyone with fairness and respect. It is considered as a baseline for good leadership. If employees are not treated with fairness and respect, they would not be satisfied and would not contribute to organizations. Four components to check fairness and respect

   1. Is the outcome fair?
   1. Is the process fair?
   1. Is the process transparent?
   1. Am I treated with respect and dignity?

1. Inclusive leaders ensure everyone feels understood and valued. Employees want to feel understood, and they want to believe that their leader knows them and understands them as an individual, not simply as a cog in the wheel. And they want to feel valued for this. This happens in every conversation between you and your employees. When you recognize someone’s strength and compliment them on that, when you know what someone’s development goals are, where they want to end up in their career, and don’t just think about what they do for your unit right now. You should know something about them outside of work, their hobbies, what they’re interested in. All of these ways of making individuals feel understood and valued. And they ultimately lead to the goal of employees feeling a sense of belongingness, but also a willingness to contribute their unique skills and talents.

1. Inclusive leaders create an open and safe environment. Inclusive leaders also have to pay attention to the environment in which the employees are working. Is it an environment that is open and safe for people to share their best ideas? Is it a place where people can bring their best selves to work everyday and feel comfortable talking about perspectives that may be different from those of others? Sometimes a diverse workforce can cause a little bit of tension. People see things differently and would cause conflict. But if a leader does a good job of opening up dialogue, allowing each person to share their unique perspective, they create that open and safe environment that ultimately is key for realizing the potential of a diverse workforce.

1. Inclusive leaders promote empowerment and growth. Inclusive leadership is not completely distinct from empowering leadership. If we are to create an inclusive environment where diverse ideas can be shared, we want to encourage empowerment and growth so that everyone has the opportunity to develop skills and to become a leader in their own right in the organization. By giving people opportunities to make decisions and by sharing both responsibility and authority, leaders give the opportunity to everyone in the organization to grow and develop in ways that allow them to become a more cohesive unit. And ultimately this lets them share their ideas in ways that are going to benefit the organization as a whole. So promoting empowerment is not just a separate style of leadership, but it is ultimately a part of inclusive leadership.

### The Eight Powerful Truths [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/deloitte-review/issue-22/diversity-and-inclusion-at-work-eight-powerful-truths.html)

1. Diversity of thinking is the new frontier

   High-performing teams are both cognitively _and_ demographically diverse. By **cognitive diversity**, we are referring to educational and functional diversity, as well as diversity in the mental frameworks that people use to solve problems. A complex problem typically requires input from six different mental frameworks or "approaches": evidence, options, outcomes, people, process, and risk. In reality, no one is equally good at all six; hence, the need for complementary team members. **Demographic diversity**, for its part, helps teams tap into knowledge and networks specific to a particular demographic group. More broadly, it can help elicit cognitive diversity through its indirect effect on personal behaviors and group dynamics.

   Diversity of thinking is powerful for three reasons. First, it helps create a stronger and broader narrative about the case for diversity, one in which _everyone_ feels relevant and part of a shared goal. Second, it more accurately reflects people's intersectional complexity instead of focusing on only one specific aspect of social or demographic identity. Third, a focus on cognitive diversity recognizes that demographic equality -- rather than being its own end -- is useful as a visible indicator of progression toward diversity of thinking.

   The truth is, optimal diversity of thinking cannot be achieved without a level playing field for all talent, and clearly there is still work to be done on that front.

1. Diversity without inclusion is not enough

   What does inclusion really mean? At its highest point, inclusion is expressed as feeling "confident and inspired."

   First, people feel included when they are treated "equitably and with respect." Participation without favoritism is the starting point for inclusion, and this requires attention to nondiscrimination and basic courtesy.

   The next element relates to "feeling valued and belonging." Inclusion is experienced when people believe that their unique and authentic self is valued by others, while at the same time have a sense of connectedness or belonging to a group.

   At its highest point, inclusion is expressed as feeling “safe” to speak up without fear of embarrassment or retaliation, and when people feel “empowered” to grow and do one’s best work. Clearly, these elements are critical for diversity of thinking to emerge.21

   The truth is that only when organizations are clear about the objective can they turn their attention to the drivers of inclusion, take action, and measure results.

1. Inclusive leaders cast a long shadow

   What distinguishes highly inclusive leaders from their counterparts? There are six signature traits of highly inclusive leaders, all of which are interrelated and mutually reinforcing.

   1. _Commitment_: They are deeply committed to diversity and inclusion because it aligns with their personal values, and they believe in the business case for diversity and inclusion. They articulate their commitment authentically, bravely challenge the status quo, and take personal responsibility for change.
   1. _Courage_: They are humble about their own capabilities and invite contributions by others.
   1. _Cognizance of bias_: They are conscious of their own blind spots as well as flaws in the system, and work hard to ensure opportunities for others.
   1. _Curiosity_: They have an open mind-set; they are deeply curious about others, listen without judgment, and seek to understand.
   1. _Culturally intelligent_: They are attentive to others’ cultures and adapt as required.
   1. _Collaboration_: They empower others and create the conditions, such as team cohesion, for diversity of thinking to flourish.

   Clearly, these traits are much more than just being “nice” to people, or even just being aware of unconscious biases. Our view is that inclusive leadership is broader and a much more intentional and effortful process. In essence, inclusion of diversity means adaptation. Leaders must alter their behaviors and the surrounding workplace to suit the needs of diverse talent, ideas, customers, and markets.

1. Middle managers matter

   Senior leaders can influence middle managers in a variety of ways, including:

   1. Using storytelling to help move people emotionally and engage them on the purpose of the D&I agenda. For example, senior leaders could share their personal stories of commitment.
   1. Addressing myths and misconceptions by ensuring that middle managers understand the fundamentals — for example, by communicating the difference between equality and equity.
   1. Having open conversations to enable questions and concerns to be surfaced. Senior leaders should enter these conversations with curiosity and courage — two of the trademark characteristics of highly inclusive leaders.
   1. Exposing middle managers to influential role models and other powerful experiences, such as putting them on high-performing, diverse teams; presenting them with counter-stereotypic examples; offering them mentoring opportunities; and giving them experiences that put them in the minority. These tactics should help managers walk in someone else’s shoes and enable perspective-taking.
   1. Making tough decisions when needed to ensure that the organizations' values are upheld. Inclusion is not a euphemism for "anything goes."

1. Rewire the system to rewire behaviors

   There are four steps to system rewiring:

   1. Using data to pinpoint leaks in the talent lifecycle. To do this, organizations can look at the profile of their employees from recruitment to retirement, coupled with data on inclusion experiences.
   1. Identifying and remodeling vulnerable moments along the talent lifecycle. These are points within specific talent processes where decision-makers are more susceptible to bias: for example, when decisions are discretionary and not subject to review.
   1. Introducing positive behavioral nudges, such as altering the default setting. In 2013, telecommunications firm Telstra introduced "All Roles Flex," which made flexibility the starting point for all jobs rather than a special arrangement for some.
   1. Tracking the impact. Periodically review diversity and inclusion data to assess the effectiveness of changes made.

1. Tangible goals make ambitions real

   When it comes to diversity and inclusion, nothing ignites greater debate than goals, targets, and quotas. On the one hand, the setting of specific diversity goals has been found to be one of the most effective methods for increasing the representation of women and other minority groups. On the other hand, contentious arguments about targets vs. quotas, accusations of reverse discrimination, and fears of incentivizing the wrong behaviors have arisen around goal-setting efforts.

   Tangible goals are important, and their impact is tied to four conditions: _communication_, _coverage_, _accountability_, and _reinforcement_.

   First, leaders should be capable of communicating confidently about what tangible goals _do_ and _do not_ mean.

   Second, tangible goals should incorporate measures of inclusion, not just diversity.

   Third, tangible goals can only work when key decision-makers are accountable.

   Finally, tangible goals are most effective when combined with broader acts of recognition and reward.

1. Match the inside and the outside

   The truth is that while many organizations have prioritized workplace diversity over customer diversity, both are equally important to business success. Moreover, customers are often more ready to support diversity and inclusion than organizations perhaps realize. But a word of caution: This is not about vacuous marketing. Commercials that lack authenticity will be shamed by the very customers they seek to attract.

1. Perform a culture reset, not a tick-the-box program

   The truth is, significant change will not happen until organizations go beyond tick-the-box programs and invest the appropriate level of effort and resourcing in creating diverse and inclusive cultures.

Workplaces have emerged as a venue in which these disparate pressures have manifested and become much discussed. Caught in the middle, workplace leaders around the world tell us that they feel ill-equipped to navigate these swirling waters. Believing in the business case, but feeling time-poor and uncertain, leaders question what to say (and what not to say) as well as what to do (and what not to do).

To address these eight powerful truths, we propose seven powerful actions:

1. Recognize that progress will take a culture reset
1. Create shared purpose and meaning by broadening the narrative to diversity of thinking and inclusion
1. Build inclusive leadership capabilities
1. Take middle managers on the journey
1. Nudge behavior change by rewiring processes and practices
1. Strengthen accountability, recognition, and rewards
1. Pay attention to diverse employees and customers

## Difficult Conversations

Up to this point, we have been focusing on positive strategies for engaging individuals and teams in the work of the organization. However, leading individuals and teams also requires dealing with problems and conflicts that arise. Leaders need to develop skills in conducting difficult conversations that help to add to the shared pool of meaning and create a foundation for developing solutions.

Crucial Conversations:

1. Opinions vary
1. Stakes are high
1. Emotions run strong

The solution: Dialogue

How to dialogue?

1. Clarify your goals for the conversation
1. Make sure that the context is safe enough for sharing
1. To restore safety...

   1. Step out
   1. Make it safe
      - Apologize when appropriate
      - Contrast to fix the misunderstanding
      - Create a mutual purpose
   1. Step back in

   Mutual Purpose + Mutual Respect = Safety

1. Understand how your attributions impact your feelings and actions.
1. Share your story as a story and retrace your path to the facts.
1. Speak persuasively, Not abrasively

   - Share the facts
   - Tell your story
   - Ask their path
   - Talk tentatively
   - Encourage testing

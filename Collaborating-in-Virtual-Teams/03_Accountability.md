# Accountability

## Personal Accountability

- Own it
- Be the change agent, not the victim
- Ask "What can I" or "How can I"
- Stay "Above the Line"

## Mutual Accountability

- No gossip or tattling to faculty
- No gang activity
- No email
- Engage in peer-to-peer conversations
  - Do the right thing, the right way with love and dignity
- Use the C.A.L.M. Model
  - Clarify the issue
  - Address the problem
  - Listen to the other side
  - Manage your way to agreement

## Peer Assessments

- Get familiar with the assessment early
- Never a surprise
- Speak the truth - nothing less
- Developmental feedback
- Make it a priority - make it matter

## The C.A.L.M. Model

- Clarify the Issue

  - Think first, plan, prepare - minimize emotions by thinking through the situation
  - Ask yourself how you might be contributing to the problem? Am I overreacting? What do I want to have happen? What don't I want to happen?
  - How would I want to be dealt with in this situation?
  - Stay focused and pick your battles!

- Address the Problem

  - Talk with the other person - face to face wherever possible
  - Use an "I" statement
  - Describe the situation, how it made you feel and its impact

- Listen to the Other Side

  - Stay open to the other person's concerns and assume positive intent
  - Demonstrate active listening
  - Stay attentive and avoid getting defensive if you are the person being confronted

- Manage Your Way to Resolution
  - Gain agreement that a problem exists
  - Identify each other's concerns and needs
  - Explore possible win-win solutions
  - Agree on a course of action
  - Identify how you will follow up and hold one another accountable
  - Say "Thank You" and be optimistic

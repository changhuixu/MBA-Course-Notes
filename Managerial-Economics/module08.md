# The Firm & Market Structures

This module examines **imperfect competition**. By the end of the module you should be able to:

- Describe the characteristics of perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly.
- Explain the relationships among price, marginal revenue, marginal cost, and profit under each market structure.
- Describe the firm’s supply function under each market structure.
- Describe and determine the optimal price and output for firms under each market structure.
- Describe pricing strategy under each market structure.
- Identify the type of market structure a firm is operating within.

## Market Structure

Market structure & degree of industry competitiveness: Affects firm pricing & output strategy and long-run profit

- _Market Structure_: # and relative size of firms and behavior in competing for input and output markets
- _Competition_: Barriers (legal, resources, governmental, etc.) to entry and exit that may inhibit the free flow of resources to their best use.
- _Profitability_: economic profit

### Analysis of Market Structures

- **Perfect competition**: large number of firms and a homogeneous product; hence, no single producer influences market prices. (no barriers to entry)
- **Monopolistic competition**: large number of firms, yet there is _product differentiation_.
- **Oligopoly**: small number of firms & each firm considers the reactions of competitors in pricing & output decision making. High barriers to entry; nonprice competition; interdependence of firms (e.g., retaliation)
- **Monopoly**: single firm that exercises control over pricing & output. Restricted entry.

### Determinants of Market Structures

Differentiating characteristics of market structures are

- number and relative size of firms,
- degree of product differentiation,
- power of the seller over pricing decisions,
- relative strength of barriers to market entry and exit, and
- degree of nonprice competition.

Each dimension affects whether firms in an industry can earn economic profits and, if so, whether they can do so in the long run.

## Characteristics of Market Structure

Market characteristics: based on _Porter’s Five Forces_:

1. Bargaining power of customers
1. Bargaining power of suppliers
1. Threat of new entrants
1. Threat of substitute products
1. Competitive rivalry within an industry

| Market Structure             | Number of Sellers | Degree of Product Differentiation | Barriers to Entry | Pricing Power of Firm | Nonprice Competition                    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Perfect Competition**      | Many              | Homogeneous/Standardized          | Very Low          | None                  | None                                    |
| **Monopolistic Competition** | Many              | Differentiate                     | Low               | Some                  | Advertising and Product Differentiation |
| **Oligopoly**                | Few               | Homogeneous/Standardized          | High              | Some or Considerable  | Advertising and Product Differentiation |
| **Monopoly**                 | One               | Unique Product                    | Very High         | Considerable          | Advertising                             |

## Demand, Revenues, Costs and Profit

- Perfectly competitive market:
  - Price is the lowest for all market structures.
  - Price = Marginal revenue = Marginal cost.
  - Economic profit is zero in the long run.
  - Elasticity is infinite: many substitute products & competitors.
  - Market demand goes down as the price increases (a downward slop in the PQ chart)
  - Firm's demand is horizontal in the PQ chart, perfectly elastic
- Monopolistic competition:
  - Price is higher relative to a perfectly competitive market.
  - Marginal revenue = Marginal cost, where marginal cost includes the cost of product differentiation.
  - Economic profit: possible in short run with differentiation but zero in long run.
    - Short-run Equilibrium: MR=MC, P1 >> C1
    - Long-run Equilibrium: AC not at min, MR=MC and economic Π=0 (costs of product differentiation)
  - Elasticity: increases as firms enter industry, which drives down P.
  - firms may attempt brand loyalty (e.g., Costco).
- Oligopoly: collusion is possible
  - MR = MC, where cost includes product differentiation.
  - Price depends on the pricing of competitors & assumptions made regarding competitors’ reactions to price changes.
  - Oligopolists earn economic profits due to barriers to entry.
  - Price elasticity depends on whether price is increased (relatively elastic) or decreased (relatively inelastic).
    - Kinked demand curve
- Monopoly
  - Marginal revenue = Marginal cost, where marginal cost includes the cost of differentiation.
  - Monopolists sell at higher prices than other market structures.
  - Barriers to entry allow the monopolist to earn economic profits.
  - As long as marginal revenue is positive, demand is elastic.

In oligopoly, MR = MC (cost includes product differentiation), price depends on the pricing of competitors and assumptions regarding competitors’ reactions to price changes, barriers to entry allow firms to earn economic profits, and price elasticity depends on whether the price is increased (relatively inelastic) or decreased (relatively elastic).

- There are different pricing strategies, each based on different assumptions regarding competitors’ reactions:
  - Cournot assumption: output of competitors will not change.
  - Stackelberg model: leader sets its output, and then follower sets its output based on the leader’s output.
- Game theory is relevant each firm in an oligopoly must anticipate competitors’ decisions.
- Collusion is possible, which may result in limited supply a price higher than without collusion; legal, more subtle collusion is price leadership.
- Examples of oligopolies in the US:
  - Retail gas stations
  - Cell phone market

### Price Discrimination

**Example:** The Firm’s total cost is 5m. It sells electricity in Iowa City and Cedar Rapids at a uniform price, \$10 per unit. It sells 800,000 units, i.e., 300,000 in Iowa City and 500,000 in Cedar Rapids. The profit is: 8m -5m = 3m.

However the firm can pursue price discrimination by charging Iowa City $9 per unit and $12 Cedar Rapids.
The profit is now:
9x300,000 + 12x500,000 – 5m = 2.7 m + 6m– 5m = 3.7m. Hence profit in increased by 700,000.

## Supply Functions

- Perfect Competition
  - Supply curve for the market is the sum of individual supply curves of individual firms.
  - Long-run marginal cost schedule is firm's supply curve.
- Monopolistic Competition
  - No well-defined supply function that determines output
- Oligopoly
  - No well-defined supply function that determines output
- Monopoly
  - No well-defined supply function.

## Duopoly

- Collusion solution (cartel) vs Cournot-Nash solution. (Cooperation vs non-cooperation).
- Duopoly means two firms produce the same product. Their strategy may be non-cooperative and naive by undercutting each other or play non- cooperatively but strategically a la Cournot-Nash using their best replies to each other. Finally, they can cooperate and form a legal cartel i.e., merge. In this case they **jointly maximize** their profits.

Three cases:

- **Cut throat competition**, i.e., p = MC.
- **Cournot-Nash, noncooperative solution**: Each firm maximizes profits taking into account the optimal response of the other first, i.e. MR1 = MC2 and MR2 = MC2
- **Collusion solution** (Cartel): joint maximization of profits, i.e., MR = MC. (Sothebys, Christies example, Alfred Taubman).

Consider two firms. Provide the profits under the two different solution concepts:

- Profits under Cournot -Nash solution:
  - Firm 1: 5,600,000
  - Firm 2: 3,000,000
- Profits under the collusion solution:
  - Firm 1: 5,000,000
  - Firm 2: 4,500,000

What is better for the firms to do - cooperate or not?

## Profit-maximizing Price and Output

- Perfect Competition
  - Price and output at point at which Marginal Revenue = Marginal Cost
  - Economic profit possible in the short run, but zero in the long run
- Monopolistic Competition
  - Price and output at point at which Marginal Revenue = Marginal Cost
  - Economic profit possible in the short run, but zero in the long run
- Oligopoly
  - Cannot determine price and output without considering pricing strategy
  - Consider retaliation in pricing and output decision making
  - Kinked demand curve
- Monopoly
  - Marginal Revenues = Long-run Marginal Cost
  - the determination of price depends on whether it is regulated.

### Factors Affecting Long-run Equilibrium

- Perfect competition:
  - economic profits attract entrants into the market, driving economic profit to zero in the long run.
  - Demand = marginal revenue and average revenue.
- Monopolistic competition:
  - economic profits attract entrants into the market, yet economic profit is zero in the long run.
- Oligopoly:
  - long-run profits are possible, but profits will attract entrants if barriers to entry are not sufficiently strong.
- Monopoly:
  - The demand curve is negatively sloped.
  - There are sufficient barriers to entry, so there are no new entrants. Therefore, the unregulated monopoly produces profits in the long run.

## Conclusions & Summary

- Four market structure categories: perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, monopoly.
- Categories differ because of the following characteristics:
  - number of producers
  - Degree of product differentiation
  - Pricing power of producer
  - Barriers to entry of new producers (moats)
  - Level of nonprice competition
- Managers: must understand characteristics of market structures to forecast a firm’s future profit stream.
- Optimal level of production in all market structures: quantity at which MR = MC.
- Only in perfect competition does MR = P. In the remaining structures, P generally > MR (firm can sell more units only by reducing per-unit price in perfect competition).
- Monopoly is:
  - good for the firm because it make always positive profits
  - bad for the society because it reduces the welfare of the consumers as they consume less & pay a higher price than competitive markets
- Duopoly, (two monopolists) do better by colluding. The Cournot-Nash non-cooperative solution (equilibrium) doesn’t give the firms optimal profits, but collusion does.

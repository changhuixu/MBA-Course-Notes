# Managerial Economics

## Module 1

The module on Essential Microeconomics introduces the supply and demand model in a competitive market. Supply and demand are the main forces that allocate scarce resources in market economies. The intersection of the supply and demand curves determine the market clearing price that consumers pay and the quantity they will buy; they also determine the quantity that firms will produce and the price the firm will receive. In short, the price movements determined by excess demand or excess supply are the "invisible hand" that guide the economy.

We will that prices adjust in competitive markets in the following way:

- When there is excess demand - prices increase to clear the market.
- When there is excess supply - prices fall to clear the market.

Successful managers must understand consumer demand (and elasticity), firm supply, and competitive markets.

**By the end of this module you should be able to:**

- Determine the equilibrium price and quantity, which occur at the point where the demand and supply curves intersect in a competitive market. You should know:
  - Demand: Price is a function of quantity, i.e., p = D(q). The slope is negative, i.e., as price goes up the quantity demanded goes down.
  - Supply: Price is a function of quantity, i.e., p = S(q). The slope is positive, i.e., as price goes up the quantity produced goes up.
  - Perfect competition prevails if no individual in the economy can influence the price at which goods are either sold or bought.
- Determine the Demand Elasticity: the percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. You should know:
  - Demand is relatively inelastic if the percentage change in the quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price.
  - Demand is relatively elastic if the percentage change in quantity is greater than the percentage change in price.
- Determine Total Surplus as the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
  - Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price that she pays.
  - Producer surplus is the difference between the market price that a producer receives and the minimum price that she is willing to accept.
  - In a competitive equilibrium, total surplus is maximized.

## Demand

**Demand**: The quantity of good and service that buyers are willing and able to buy at all possible prices during a certain time period.

Two components in "Demand": (1) willingness to buy, and (2) ability to pay.

**Law of Demand"**: As the price of a good increases, the quantity of that good demanded decreases. Likewise, as the price of a good or service decreases, the quantity of that good or service demanded increases.

Notice that we include only two variables: price and quantity. Thatâ€™s all that the law of demand does, it states how a change in the price of a good or service affects the quantity demanded.

**What Things Change the Curve?**

There are several reasons a demand curve might shift to the left or the right. In each of the following examples, imagine that the price of chocolate bars remains constant but something else in the market changes.

- A change in consumer expectations.
- A change in consumer tastes or preferences.
- A change in the number of consumers in the market.
- A change in income. During recessions, the demand curve usually shifts to the left.
- A change in the price of a substitute good.
- A change in the price of a complementary good.

## Supply

**Supply**: The quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to offer for sale at each possible price during a given time period.

**Law of Supply**: As the price of a good or service rises, the quantity of the good or service also rises. Likewise, as the price of a good or service falls, the quantity of the good or service also falls.

**Factors of change in market conditions**

- A change of the cost of inputs to the production process.
- A change in the number of producers in the market.
- Government policies, such as taxes, subsidies and regulations.
- Expectations of future prices.

**Two types of movements of the supply curve**

- a shift along the curve that we call a **change in the quantity supplied** that reflects the change in price
- the shift of the curve that we call the **change in supply** that reflects in change in market conditions.

## Equilibrium

**Quantity Demanded**: The amount of a good that buyers are willing and able to purchase at a particular price. Many things determine demand, but only price can determine the quantity demanded of a specific good.

**Quantity Supplied**: The quantity of a good or service is the amount of a good that sellers are willing and able to sell at a particular price. Many factors affect supply, but only price can determine the quantity supplied.

**Equilibrium: supply and demand work together to determine price**: At the equilibrium price, there is no shortage or surplus. The quantity of the good that buyers are willing to buy equals the quantity that sellers are willing to sell.

Markets do have a natural tendency to settle at the equilibrium price, but the price may bounce around a bit in the process.

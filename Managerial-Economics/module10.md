# Antitrust and Multilateral Institutions

In this module we will discuss the role of Antitrust Policy in promoting competition within a country and the role of Multilateral Institutions, such as the IMF, World Bank and WTO, in promoting global stability and growth.

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Identify the key Anti-trust legislation, including how the policies promote competition.
- Identify the role of the IMF, World Bank and WTO in promoting macroeconomic stability, growth and trade.

## Antitrust Laws

- **Antitrust regulations**: intended to prohibit abusive and anticompetitive behavior (exclusive dealings & refusals to deal, price discrimination, and predatory pricing).
  - Example of antitrust concern: software bundling by Microsoft
  - Example of use of antitrust for competitive advantage: Microsoft EU claims against Google
- **Challenge**: antitrust issues may involve many different regulators.
  - US: Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, etc.

### Sherman Antitrust Act

- Passed in 1890 due to concern that growth & expansion of monopolies were detrimental to the free market system in the US and citizens in general.
- First attempt by the federal government to control the growth of big business.
- Goal: control the growth of monopolies that restrained trade
  - No price fixing (agreements among firms to control prices)
  - No market allocation/territorial agreements
  - No boycotts in restraint of trade

### Clayton Act 1914

- Clarified ambiguities in the Sherman Act
- Prohibits:
  - Price discrimination
  - Tying agreements
  - Binding contracts that restrict supplier choice by purchasers
  - Interlocking directorates of board members of competing firms
  - Purchasing stocks of competitors (community interests)
- Eased burden of proof
- Triple damages

### Federal Trade Commission Act 1914

- FTC: Charged with keeping competition free & fair
- Enforce Clayton Act
- Anti-trust laws are also enforced by
  - Dept of Justice
  - State agencies

### Consumer Protection Standard

- Antitrust: focus on consumer harm/welfare
- US Supreme Court Case 1979 Reiter vs Sonotone: Established a _consumer protection standard_
- New Goal of Antitrust Law: Consumer welfare

### No Supra-national Legal Authority

But, international trade enhances economic growth:

- Increase efficiency of the allocation of resources
- Provide larger capital & product markets
- Assist specialization based on comparative advantage
- Increase efficiency of flow of capital among countries

## Benefits & costs of International trade

**BENEFITS**

- Gain from exchange and specialization
- Greater economies of scale
- Greater product variety
- Increased competition
- More efficient resource allocation

**COSTS**

- Greater income inequality
- Loss of jobs in developed countries
- Adjustments as resources are reallocated

### Comparative Advantage

- **Absolute advantage (AA)**: country can produce good at lower cost or use fewer resources; Best producer of a good, based on productivity in terms of opportunity cost, but not necessarily the lowest-cost producer.
- **Comparative advantage (CA)**: countryâ€™s opportunity cost of producing good < trading partner; lowest-cost producer of a good.
- Can have CA but not AA producing a good
- Greater the difference between world price of good & autarkic price, the more potential gain from trade
- CA can change over time

## Trade and Capital Flows: restrictions & agreements

- **Tariff**: tax levied by a govt on imported goods
  - Intended to protect domestic industries
  - Increases welfare of domestic country if: (1) no retaliation, and (2) deadweight loss < benefit from improving trade
- **Import quota**: restriction on quantity of good that can be imported
  - Controlled through import licenses
  - Importers earn quota rents if they charge a higher price with a quota
- **Export subsidy**: payment by govt to a firm when it exports a good

  - Encourages firms to shift to export goods, increases the domestic price
  - **Voluntary export restraint (VER)**: voluntary limit on goods exported to a specific country.
  - Allows exporter to earn **quota rents**

- **Domestic content provisions**: requirements that a specific portion of value-added or components be produced domestically.
- **Capital restrictions**: controls placed on ownership of assets, either of foreign assets or of ownership of domestic assets by foreign persons or firms.
- **Effect of restrictions on trade & capital**: depends on whether the country is a price taker or can affect price:
  - **small country**: price taker
  - **large country**: can influence the price

## Trading Blocs

**Trading bloc**: agreement among countries to work to eliminate trade barriers. May be regional (NAFTA, EU). Different degrees of integration are possible.

- Economic union: coordination of economic policies among members
- Common market: allows free movement of factors of production
- Customs union: common trade policy regarding nonmembers
- Free trade area (FTA): trading block with no trade barriers

### Why Trading Blocs?

1. Increased competition
   - Lowers prices & increases quantity
1. Cost of production declines
   - Easier access to natural resources & technology
1. Increased access to technology & knowledge
1. Increased specialization
1. Greater opportunity for economies of scale
1. Increased employment
1. Increased income
1. Increased interdependence among members
   - Less chance of conflicts

# Accessing Monopoly

Learning Objectives

- Explain and illustrate that a monopoly firm produces an output that is less than the efficient level and why this results in a deadweight loss to society.
- Explain and illustrate how the higher price that a monopoly charges, compared to an otherwise identical perfectly competitive firm, transfers part of consumer surplus to the monopolist and raises questions of equity.
- Considering both advantages and disadvantages, discuss the potential effects that a monopoly may have on consumer choices, price, quality of products, and technological innovations.
- Discuss the public policy responses to monopoly.

Consumer surplus is the difference between what consumers are willing to pay for a good and what they actually pay.

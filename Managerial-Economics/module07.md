# Fiscal Policy

**Fiscal Policy** is the means by which a government changes its spending level (G) and tax rates (T) influence a nation's economy. In this module we will observe historical and cross country patterns in government expenditures, taxes, deficits and debt.

By the end of this module you should be able to...

- Identify budget balance, surplus and deficit.
- Distinguish between cyclical and structural deficits.
- Compute real budget deficits (versus nominal) and assess the differential effect of inflation on borrowers and savers.
- Assess the likely impacts of fiscal policy.
- Identify the effects of important fiscal shocks (e.g., wars and pandemics) and trends (e.g., longer life expectancy, demographic changes in work force participation.)
- Interpret and use Congressional Budget Office (CBO) fiscal projections.

## Monetary Policy vs Fiscal Policy

- Monetary policy: set of activities of a nation’s central bank that are intended to affect the money supply & credit in the economy.
- Fiscal policy: set of activities of a nation’s govt, including taxation and spending, that can affect an economy.

## Fiscal Policy (FP)

- Objectives of fiscal policy: influence aggregate demand (AD) using tools such as taxes & govt spending (T, G).
- Effectiveness of FP: depends on the economy & there is debate over whether it is helpful:
  - Keynesians: believe FP is effective in affecting AD
  - Monetarists: believe FP effectiveness is only temporary
- Govt receipts: taxes on income and taxes on goods & services.
- Fiscal policy examples:

  - Expansionary FP: Increase spending (G)
  - Contractionary FP: Increase taxes (T)

- Roles & objectives of fiscal policy: influence Aggregate Demand (AD) using taxes (T) and government spending (G).
- Expansionary fiscal policy: increased spending & contractionary fiscal policy may increase taxes.

## Budget surplus/deficit

- **Budget surplus**: govt revenues exceed govt spending
- **Budget deficit**: govt revenues less than govt spending.
- Automatic stabilizers: self-correcting mechanisms
  - Examples:
    - Recession: govt transfer payments increase (unemployment benefits).
    - Booming: taxes increase (especially if progressive).
  - Stabilizers may exaggerate or exacerbate fiscal policies if not taken into account by the govt.
- National debt of a country increases with govt deficits.
  - At some point, a nation will be considered insolvent.

## Issue: Concern about National Debt?

- _No concern regarding national debt_

  - Much of a nation's debt is owed internally.
  - Some of the debt may have been incurred to finance capital projects or to enhance human capital, which should contribute to the growth of the economy.
  - Large deficits may encourage changes in tax laws, which may contain distortions.
  - Private sector saving may increase.
  - If there is unemployment, debt is not taking funds from productive uses.

- _National debt as a concern_
  - A high debt-to-GDP ratio may lead to higher taxes and hence disincentives.
  - Lack of confidence in the government may exist, making some policies ineffective.
  - Government borrowing diverts funds from more productive uses (referred to as **crowding out**).

## Fiscal Policy Tools

- Fiscal policy tools
  - transfer payments (welfare & social security)
  - current govt spending on goods & services
  - capital expenditures (spending on infrastructure)
- Govt spending: justified on economic & social grounds
- Govt revenues:
  - direct taxes: income or corporate taxes
  - indirect taxes: excise duties & taxes on gambling income
- Taxes generate govt revenue: for spending & income redistribution.
  - Desirable properties of a tax policy: simplicity, efficiency, fairness, and revenue sufficiency.

Advantages of fiscal policy tools

- Indirect taxes can be adjusted quickly.
- Social policies can be affected quickly using excise taxes (e.g., on tobacco).

Disadvantages of fiscal policy tools

- Direct taxes are difficult to change quickly because of their complexity.
- Capital spending takes planning and time to implement, which makes it a slow-acting and possibly ill-timed tool.

## Fiscal Multiplier

The fiscal multiplier is a common metric used in macroeconomics to summarize the impact of fiscal spending or tax changes on GDP over a particular period. A multiplier of 1.0 implies $1 increase in GDP results from every $1 of stimulus.

- **Marginal propensity to consume** (MPC): proportion of additional income that is spent on consumption.
  - Complement of MPC is **marginal propensity to save** (MPS).
  - MPC determines the effectiveness of fiscal policies that affect income.
- **Fiscal multiplier**: measure of effectiveness of fiscal policy (change in output for a change in spending or taxation):

        fiscal multiplier = 1/(1-c) = 1/s (since c + s = 1).

  where c is the MPC, and 0 < c < 1.

* With taxes,

        fiscal multiplier = 1/[1-(1-t)c]

* If govt spending increases by the same amount as the increase in taxes, output rises because c < 1.

A fiscal policy is **contractionary** if it reduces output, whereas a fiscal policy is **expansionary** if it increases output. The fiscal multiplier is a summary of the relationship between the marginal propensity to consume, the tax rate, output, and government spending, and we can use this relationship to predict the outcomes of fiscal policies on aggregate demand.

The equation is a guide for the impact of govt spending and taxes on equilibrium output.

Example: if the MPC is held constant and the tax rate is increased, this multiplier indicates that this would be a contractionary policy.

**Questions:**

1. If tax rates are lowered and if the MPC is constant at 90%, what is the expected effect of the change in taxes? Why?

   Answer: Increased multiplier, so a more significant effect of any change in personal income

1. Based on a MPC of 80% and a tax rate of 30%, what is the effect of €100 more in personal income?

   Answer: €100 × 1/[1 – (0.80)(0.70)] = €100 × 2.2727 = €227.27

### Individual Transfers

**Individual Transfers**: direct fiscal transfers to individuals, especially the tax rebates of 2008

Traditional economic theory predicts a much smaller MPC, around 0.05, from a one-time influx of income such as a tax rebate. The small MPC is based on the logic that individuals smooth their consumption over their lifetimes, borrowing when income is low and saving when income is high, and will only spend out of a temporary income boost in proportion to its impact on lifetime income.

The MPC during the current crisis could be quite high for many households, for example those experiencing layoffs, as they use transfer funds for basic needs such as food, housing, and utilities. However, many other households, for example employed or retired, may have an MPC closer to zero because many types of spending are less available due to social distancing. In general, the more severe and prolonged the economic downturn, the higher the share of households that will be liquidity constrained and the more households will need to use transfer income for basic needs, pushing up overall MPC.

### Government consumption.

**Government purchases** of goods and services is the canonical type of government spending analyzed in most empirical macroeconomic studies of the fiscal spending multiplier.

The consumption effect of ARRA spending imply a multiplier around 1.5, the multiplier may be as high as 1.5 to 2.0 during ZLB periods. In addition, separate analyses of how the fiscal multiplier differs in recessions and expansions have generally found larger multipliers in recessions.

### Transfers to state and local governments.

An important issue for determining the multiplier on transfers to state and local governments is the “flypaper effect.” This refers to the portion of federal money state and local governments receive that they actually spend as opposed to saving or financing tax cuts. This is analogous to the MPC for individual transfers.

The marginal propensities to spend out of federal transfers by state and local governments are particularly high during times of fiscal strain, suggesting at least a dollar-for-dollar pass-through to spending.

## Real Deficit

The nominal federal budget deficit in the U.S. was about $1 trillion (before Covid-19). If the inflation rate is 2%, and outstanding debt is $22 trillion, what is the real deficit?

    Real deficit = nominal deficit – (amount of debt x inflation) 

Real Deficit = $1 - ($22 x 0.02) = 1 - 0.44 = 0.56 trillion

Note: Inflation lowers the real deficit

## Effectiveness of Fiscal Policy

- Budget (surplus or deficit): may not indicate govt fiscal stance because automatic stabilizers affect the budget
  - Look at the **structural** (or cyclical) **budget deficit**
- Fiscal policy is difficult to use to stabilize AD because
  - Lags:
    - **recognition lag**: lag between slowing economy & data to assess it
    - **action lag**: may take several months to implement
    - **impact lag**: may take time for impact on the economy
- Difficult to predict where the economy is heading apart from FP. Some policies may make things worse.

Real potential GDP is the maximum sustainable output of the economy, adjusted to remove the effects of inflation. The two contributing factors are the potential labor force and potential labor force productivity. The potential labor force is the labor force (that is, the number of people in the civilian noninstitutionalized population who are age 16 or older and who are either working or actively seeking work) adjusted to remove the effects of fluctuations in the business cycle. Potential labor force productivity is the ratio of potential GDP to the potential labor force.

There are only 3 ways to a budget deficit. (1) increase taxes (2) decrease expenditures (3) grow the GDP.

## Monetary & Fiscal Policy

- MP & FP: use different channels to affect the economy but may have similar policy objectives.
  - Policies may conflict or enhance one another.
  - Because of potential for MP & FP to conflict, coordination between govt & central bank is important
  - Challenging because of lags in data & inability to predict the future path of the economy.
- Example of interaction: quantitative easing used to purchase govt debt -> FP & MP interact.

## Conclusion & Summary

- Fiscal policy: use of G & T to affect the economy.
- FP: the way a govt raises revenue & spends
- FP: can play an important role in stabilizing an economy
- FP & MP can alter AD, but work through different channels. The policies are not interchangeable and can conflict unless the govt & central bank coordinate their objectives.

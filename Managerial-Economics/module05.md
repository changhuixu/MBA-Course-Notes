# Monetary Policy and the Money Supply Process

In this module we discuss the _U.S. Monetary System_ and the _Money Supply Process_. The U.S. suffered a Great Depression in the 1930s, which was exacerbated by inappropriate monetary policy. The U.S. experienced a financial crisis and Great Recession in 2008. You will see that monetary policy played an important role that was successful in stabilizing the U.S. and global economy during these past crises. The U.S. is currently in the midst of the "Great Cessation" (i.e., significant parts of the macroeconomy are shut down due to the global Covid-19 pandemic). The FED is again engaged in massive policy interventions. We will discuss the fundamentals of monetary policy and see how these tools (conventional and unconventional) are applied to all three historical episodes.

By the end of this module you should be able to

- Identify the the structure, tools, and goals of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (the FED) and the nature of money.
- Use the Money Supply Process model to assess the role of three key players: the Central Bank (FED), private banking system, and public, including what each player affects.
- Identify Conventional Monetary Policy tools.
- Identify Unconventional Monetary Policy tool (i.e. Quantitative Easing).

## Monetary and Fiscal Policy Intro

**Monetary Policy**: Set of Central Bank activities: affect money supply & credit (M<sup>s</sup>)

**Fiscal Policy**: Set of Government activities: taxation & spending (G, T)

### Monetary Policy

**Money**: _medium of exchange_ that can be used to purchase goods & services and to repay debts.

Qualities necessary for money to be a medium of exchange:

- Readily acceptable
- Known value
- Easily divisible
- High value relative to its weight
- Difficult to counterfeit

Money has three main functions:

- medium of exchange
- way to store wealth
- convenient measure of value & unit of account

### Creating Money

- **Reserve requirement (RR)**: percentage of deposited funds a bank must keep in reserve (not lend out).
- Amount of money in banking system is a function of the reserve requirement:
  - Higher reserve requirement -> less funds available to lend
  - Lower reserve requirement -> more funds available to lend
- **Simple money multiplier**: Summarizes the effect of the reserve requirement on the money supply:

      				m = 1/(reserve requirement)

  - If reserve requirement is 5% -> money multiplier is 20 times
  - If reserve requirement is 10% -> money multiplier is 10 times

The amount of money in the banking system is a function of the reserve requirement, which is the percentage of deposited funds that a bank must keep on hand. As demand deposits are created and a portion of these funds are lent by banks, money is created. The effect of the reserve requirement on the money supply is summarized with the money multiplier, which is the inverse of the reserve requirement.

In the US, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System establishes the reserve requirement. For banks with more than \$89 million in transaction accounts, the current reserve requirement is 10%.

### Process of Money Creation

_Assume: banks must keep 5% of deposits in reserve; Money multiplier = 1/0.05 = 20 times_

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Money Supply | Bank Assets | Bank Liabilities |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------------- |
| **Step 1**: Person A deposits $100 in OneBank <ul><li>Person A has an asset at OneBank for $100.</li><li>OneBank has a liability to Person A for $100 and an asset of $100.</li></ul>                                                                                                              | \$100        | \$100       | \$100            |
| **Step 2**: OneBank loans $95 to Person B by putting it in a checking account.<ul><li>Person B has a liability to OneBank for $95, and an asset of $95 in the checking account.</li><li>OneBank has an asset (loan) to Person B for $95, and a liability for the demand deposit of \$95.</li></ul> | \$195        | \$195       | \$195            |
| **Step 3**: Person B uses the $90 to buy from Person C.<ul><li>Person C deposits the funds in TwoBank.</li><li>TwoBank lends $85.5 to Person D.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                          | \$280.5      | \$280.5     | \$280.5          |

Simplified example: These are only the first three steps in the process; with a 5% reserve requirement, the $100 deposit can create $2,000 of funds.

### Definitions of Money

**Money stock**: coins & currency in circulation, plus deposits in banks & other financial institutions, which can be used to make purchases of goods & services.

- **Narrow money**: notes & coins in circulation plus highly liquid deposits.
- **Broad money**: narrow money plus all liquid assets that can be used to make purchases.

### Quantity Theory of Money

**Quantity theory of money**: total spending is proportional to the quantity of money.

**Quantity equation of exchange**:

            M × V = P × Y

where

    M = Money supply
    V = Velocity of the circulation of money
    P = Average price level
    Y = Real output

**Money neutrality**: situation in which an increase in the money supply (M) will not affect output (Y) or the velocity of money (V), but it will affect price level, P.

### Confronting the QT with Data

The quantity theory of money implies:

1. Countries with higher money growth rates should have higher inflation rates.
1. The long-run trend behavior of a country’s inflation should be similar to the long-run trend in the country's money growth rate.

_Are the data consistent with these implications?_

### Demand & Supply of Money

**Demand for money**: Motives for holding money:

1. **Transactions**: need liquidity to transact (positively related to GDP)
1. **Precautionary**: buffer for unexpected events
1. **Speculative motives**: held in anticipation that other assets will decline in value
   - "Cash is King"
   - Speculative balances are lower when returns on other assets increase

**Supply of money**: assumed to be fixed (right now) (unchanged by the nominal rate of interest), but changes in the supply of money will affect price levels and nominal rates of interest.

When the supply curve is vertical -> changes in the demand for money affect

- price level
- nominal interest rate

**Money Market Equilibrium**

Graph of the money supply & money demand curves: nominal rate on the vertical axis, quantity of money on the horizontal axis).

Money market equilibrium occurs where Money Supply equals Money Demand, at a market clearing interest rate and quantity. Money demand is determined by individuals. Money Supply is a process that involves the Central Bank, Public, and the Private Banking System. We will discuss this in detail.

### The Fisher Effect

**Fisher effect**: real rate of interest is stable over time, & so are changes in nominal interest rates because of changes in inflation expectations.

        R<sub>nom</sub> = R<sub>real</sub> + π<sup>e</sup>

where

        R<sub>nom</sub>: nominal interest rate
        R<sub>real</sub>: real rate of interest
        π<sup>e</sup>: expected rate of inflation

Investors: demand a **risk premium** for uncertainty regarding inflation & real growth.

        R<sub>nom</sub> = R<sub>real</sub> + π<sup>e</sup> + R<sub>m</sub>

The data are consistent with the Fisher effect: _inflation and the nominal interest rate are very highly correlated_. However, they are not perfectly correlated, which does not invalidate the Fisher effect. Over time, the saving and investment curves move around, causing the real interest rate to move, which, in turn, causes the nominal interest rate to change for a given value of inflation.

Note:

- The inflation rate is the percentage change in the CPI from 12 months earlier.
- The nominal interest rate is the 3-month Treasury bill rate in the secondary market.

### Role of Central Banks

**Central Bank**: Banker to the govt, other banks, & supplier of the nation’s currency.

Central banks often

- Supervise the banking system
- Regulate & oversee the payments system
- Manage foreign currency & gold reserves
- Operate monetary policy (MP)

Objective of Central Bank:

- Stability of financial system
- manage payments system
- set & implement MP (e.g., 0 to 2% inflation)

#### What is the Fed?

The Federal Reserve often referred to as “the Fed” is the central bank of the United States.

Congress created the Fed in 1913 to help promote a safe and sound monetary and financial
system for our nation. The Fed includes the Board of Governors in Washington D.C. which has
seven members including the Chairman and Vice Chairman. All of the members of the Board are
appointed of the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. The
Fed also includes 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks located in cities throughout the country.

The Reserve Banks serve as the central banks' operating arms and also gather economic
information from all over the country to help the Fed both monitor the economy and get the
broad input necessary to develop and implement effective U.S. monetary policy. Today, the Fed
performs a number of important functions all with the ultimate goal of promoting a healthy U.S.
economy.

One of the Fed's more recognizable functions is conducting U.S. monetary policy.
Which involves influencing interest rates and the availability of money and credit in our
economy. Congress has tasked the Fed with implementing monetary policies that promote
maximum employment and stable prices. High levels of employment provide people with more
economic opportunities and stable prices promote growth, by making it easier for households and
businesses to plan for the future. Monetary policy decisions at the Fed are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, which includes all seven members of the Board of Governors and presidents from the reserve banks. This committee meets regularly to assess the conditions and outlook for the economy.

In addition to conducting monetary policy, the Federal Reserve also helps to supervise and regulate the nation's banks and works to promote a stable financial system
for consumers, communities, and businesses. The Fed also works with communities, non-profit
organizations, and others across the nation to address housing problems, promote equal access to
credit, and advance economic and community development. The Fed also promotes stability in
the financial system because instability in the financial system can pose a severe threat to the
broader economy and communities across the nation. The Fed also acts as a bank to other banks
by clearing checks, making electronic payments, and providing the currency that American's
need and use every day. Our nation's economy and financial system face constant challenges.
The Fed is working every day to address those challenges and is committed to helping foster
good economic conditions and outcomes, employment opportunities, stable prices, and financial
stability that benefit all Americans.

The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States. It performs five general functions to promote the effective operation of the U.S. economy and, more generally, the public interest. The Federal Reserve

- conducts the nation’s monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the U.S. economy;
- promotes the stability of the financial system and seeks to minimize and contain systemic risks through active monitoring and engagement in the U.S. and abroad;
- promotes the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and monitors their impact on the financial system as a whole;
- fosters payment and settlement system safety and efficiency through services to the banking industry and the U.S. government that facilitate U.S.-dollar transactions and payments; and
- promotes consumer protection and community development through consumer-focused supervision and examination, research and analysis of emerging consumer issues and trends, community economic development activities, and the administration of consumer laws and regulations.

### Monetary Policy Tools

1. **Open market operations**: Purchases & sales of (usually) govt bonds from and to commercial banks or market makers.
1. **Change the policy interest rate**: Influences other rates in economy
   - **Repurchase rate** (repo rate): rate at which the central bank agrees to buy or sell bonds to commercial banks through a repurchase agreement.
     - In the US,
       - **discount rate**: rate at which member banks borrow from the central bank
       - **federal funds rate**: rate on interbank lending on overnight borrowing or reserves
1. **Change the reserve requirement**: Requirement by central bank that banks keep a specified % of deposits on hand, which affects the money supply.

### Central Bank Policies

- Inflation targeting
  - Central banks seek price-level stability
    - Unexpected inflation: Costly because not factored into wage negotiations & contracts. Inflation uncertainty can affect the business cycle.
    - Inflation targeting: Maintain price stability using monetary policy.
    - Common target: 0 to 2% based on the CPI
  - Developing nations: challenges to price stability (illiquid govt bond market, changing economy, changing definition of money supply, lack of credibility).
- Exchange rate targeting: used by a few countries
  - Set a band for the target exchange rate against a major currency.
  - Central bank buys & sells foreign currency toward the goal.
  - Risk: Speculators may trade against the monetary authority.

Central banks may establish policies that address inflation or exchange rates. Example: inflation targeting generally involves the use of monetary policies to achieve preset inflation targets.

- US: does not have explicit inflation targets, but some countries do (e.g., Canada and New Zealand have a 2% target).

### Effective Central Banks

Characteristics of effective central banks:

- _Independent_: Often independent of the govt, but the degree of independence varies among nations.
- _Credible_: Necessary for efficient execution of monetary policy (transparency is one aspect of credibility).

### Neutral Rate

- Neutral rate of interest: interest rate that neither encourages nor discourages growth

        Neutral rate = Trend growth + Inflation target

  - Expansionary & contractionary policies: evaluate compared to the neutral rate of interest.

- Inflation shocks (deviations from expected inflation) arise from:
  - Demand shock: pressure from increased consumption & investment
  - Supply shock: pressure for an increased price level from an increase in prices of inputs (example: oil) or deflation from Covid-19 (lock down).
- Monetary authorities should determine the source of inflationary pressure before applying any particular policy

### Limitations of Monetary Policy

Limitations of monetary policy: imperfect nature of channels (e.g., asset prices or responsiveness of interest rates), which make the efficient transmission of policy challenging.

- MP transmission mechanism problems:
  - Asset prices, interest rates, expectations & exchange rates may not be efficient
  - Liquidity trap: If market participants hold large cash balances, changes in the money supply will not affect real activity
- **Quantitative easing** (QE): Increase in money supply (M<sup>s</sup>) intended to stimulate the economy.
  - QE can take many forms: purchase of specific securities, such as mortgage or Covid-19 bonds
  - Risk: If securities with credit risk are purchased, the central bank may take on significant risk

### Conclusions & Summary

- Govts: can influence economies by using MP & FP.
- Money: medium of exchange, store of wealth, unit of account
- Banking system: creates M through fractional reserve banking
- Motives to hold M: transactions, precautionary, speculative
- Nominal rate of interest components: real required rate of return has components to compensate lenders for future inflation + risk premium for uncertainty
- Central Bank roles: monopoly supplier of currency, lender of last resort to banks, govt’s bank, supervises banks
- Central bank should be independent from the govt, credible, & transparent in goals and objectives
- Limits to the power of MP
- Inflation targeting: most common MP

## International Macroeconomic Environment of the Firm

### Money Supply Process Players

1. **Central Bank**: Responsible for controlling the money supply & regulating the banking system

1. **Private Banking System**: Creates checking accounts (most important component of the M1=C+R measure of the money supply)

1. **Nonbank Public**: All households & firms decide the form in which to hold money (currency or checking account balances).

### Money Supply Process:

- It is important to understand the money supply process because having too much or too little money will lead to negative economic outcomes including high(er) inflation and low(er) total output.
- The central bank, depository institutions of every stripe, borrowers, and depositors all help to determine the money supply.
- The central bank helps to determine the money supply by controlling the monetary base (_M<sup>B</sup>_), aka high-powered money or its monetary liabilities.
- The central bank’s balance sheet differs from those of other banks because its monetary liabilities, currency in circulation (C) and reserves (R), are everyone else's assets.
- The monetary base or _M<sup>B</sup>_ = C + R, where C = currency in circulation (not in the central bank or any bank); R = reserves = bank vault cash and deposits with the central bank.

**Issue**: During & after the financial crisis, bank reserves increased rapidly in the US.

**Questions**:

- Why did reserves increase during & after the 2007-09 financial crisis? (See the graphs for the money base & excess reserves)
- Should the increase concern policymakers?
- What is happening now???

**Answer**: _The Money Supply Process_

### Organizing Idea: _M<sup>S</sup>_ = _m_ _M<sup>B</sup>_

**Intuition**: The equation states that Money Supply (_M<sup>S</sup>_) is linked to Money Base (_M<sup>B</sup>_) by money multiplier (_m_).

- _M<sup>S</sup>_ = C + D: Money Supply is Currency + Deposits
- _M<sup>B</sup>_ = C + R: Money Base is Currency + Reserves,

  where R = RR + ER in words: Reserves = Required Reserves + Excess Reserves

- In the simple case the multiplier was: _m_ = _1/RR_.

**Question**: What is the multiplier when we consider actions by the banking system and the public (i.e., Money Supply Process)?

**Point**: If the value of money multiplier is stable → Central Bank can control the money supply by controlling the money base.

#### M1 Money Stock

M1 includes funds that are readily accessible for spending. M1 consists of:

- (1) currency outside the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, and the vaults of depository institutions;
- (2) traveler's checks of nonbank issuers;
- (3) demand deposits; and
- (4) other checkable deposits (OCDs), which consist primarily of negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts at depository institutions and credit union share draft accounts.

Seasonally adjusted M1 is calculated by summing currency, traveler's checks, demand deposits, and OCDs, each seasonally adjusted separately.

The currency component of M1, sometimes called "**money stock currency**", is defined as currency in circulation outside the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve Banks. Data on total currency in circulation are obtained weekly from balance sheets of the Federal Reserve Banks and from the U.S. Treasury. Weekly currency in circulation data are published each week on the Federal Reserve Board's H.4.1 statistical release "Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks." Vault cash is reported on the FR 2900 and subtracted from total currency in circulation. For institutions that do not file the FR 2900, vault cash is estimated using data reported on the Call Reports.

### Money Base: _M<sup>B</sup>_ = _C_ + _R_

- **C**: Currency in circulation = Currency outstanding – Vault cash
- **R**: Reserves = Bank deposits at Fed + Vault cash

**Reserves = RR + ER**

- RR: Required reserves FED requires banks to hold
- ER: Excess reserves (banks choose to hold above the level required by law). Banks may choose the hold more than the required reserves (e.g., if macroeconomic conditions are poor)

Note: Reserve deposits are assets for banks, but liabilities for the Fed (banks can request the Fed to repay the deposits on demand with Federal Reserve Notes.)

### Conventional Monetary Policy

- **Open Market Operations**: Central Bank (FED) purchase & sales of securities, usually US Treasuries. Open market operations occur whenever a central bank buys or sells assets, usually government bonds.
  - By purchasing bonds (or anything else for that matter), the central bank increases the monetary base and hence, by some multiple, the money supply. (Picture the central bank giving up some money to acquire the bond, thereby putting FRN or reserves into circulation.)
  - By selling bonds, the central bank decreases the monetary base and hence the money supply by some multiple. (Picture the central bank giving up a bond and receiving money for it, removing FRN or reserves from circulation.)
  - Similarly, the MB and MS increase whenever the Fed makes a loan, and they decrease whenever a borrower repays the Fed.
- **Reserve Requirements**: Not significant in US
- **Discount Loans** (borrowed reserves B): Loans made by the FED, usually to commercial banks
  - _Discount rate_: Interest rate set by the FED (usually rates are set in a market by S&D)
  - FED controls
    - _Non-borrowed base_: directly
    - _Borrowed Reserves_: indirectly through the discount rate

### _M<sup>B</sup>_ Exploded During the Financial Crisis

Most of the increase was due to an _increase in bank reserves_ (R), not currency in circulation (C).

FED holdings of Treasury securities actually _fell_ while the base was exploding.

QE: FED began by purchasing assets of Bear Stearns & AIG. The asset side of its balance sheet expanded & so did the money base.

Point: _Whenever the Fed purchases assets of any kind, M<sup>B</sup> increases_. It does not matter if the assets are Treasury bills, mortgage-backed securities, or something else.

### Simple Deposit Multiplier

In general, the simple deposit multiplier is _1/RR_. **RR** is the required reserves set by the FED.

           ΔD = ΔR/RR

In the example, ΔD = $100,000/.10 =$1,000,000

### Augmented Multiplier

The **simple money multiplier** made two key assumptions:

1. **Private banks**: hold no excess reserves (ER)
1. **Nonbank public**: doesn’t increase currency holdings (C)

These assumptions mean that the simple deposit multiplier overestimates the multiple deposit creation process, providing us with an upper-bound estimate.

**Augmented multiplier** includes RR and:

- Nonbank public: may hold currency relative to checkable deposits (C/D)
- Private banks: may hold excess reserves relative to deposits (ER/D)

            M<sup>S</sup> = m M<sup>B</sup>
            C + D = m (C + R) = m (C + RR + ER)
            m = (C+D)/(C+RR+ER)

- Ex.: C = $500 billion, D = $1,000 billion, RR/D = .1, ER = \$150 billion gives

            Reserves (R) = Excess Reserves + Required Reserves = 2

  A $1 billion increase in _M<sup>B</sup>_ results in a \$2 billion increase in M

### Money Supply Process Summary

1. Money supply changes in the same direction as a change in either the money base or money multiplier.
1. Increase in currency-to-deposit ratio (C/D) causes the value of the money multiplier & money supply to decline.
1. Increase in required reserve ratio (RR/D) causes the value of the money multiplier & money supply to decline.
1. Increase in excess reserves-to-deposit ratio (ER/D) causes the value of the money multiplier & money supply to decline.

#### Why did the MB increase so much more than M1?

A higher excess reserves-to-deposit ratio (ER/D) will cause a decrease in the money multiplier, and a lower currency-to-deposit ratio (C/D) will increase the multiplier.

Because the increase in (ER/D) was significantly larger than the decline in (C/D), the value of the money multiplier declined and the increase in the money base resulted in a much smaller increase in M1 than would have occurred if the value of the money multiplier had remained what it was at the beginning of the financial crisis.

**Summary**: Banks’ large holdings of ERs concern some investors, policymakers & economists about future inflation.

If banks suddenly lend their ERs, the MS could explode and, potentially, inflation could increase.

This need not occur: See the QE discussion.

The rapid increase in bank reserves that began in the fall of 2008 resulted from FED asset purchases (see the MB figure):
**When the FED purchases any asset, the money base increases.**

The increase in reserves was very large (MB = C + R):

- Banks are content to hold large ERs because the FED is paying interest on them (the FED can change this).
- There was increased risk in alternative uses of the funds.

Inflation remains very low. Policy was being “unwound,” but is now being aggressively increased due to Covid-19.

### Summary

- There are many definitions of MB (called M1, M2, M3, …). Central Banks control C+R, but cannot directly control other components.
- “Near monies” are concerning.
- Central banks are major players in the money supply process, but confidence by individuals & banks is crucial.
- On-going financial innovation is important. Central banks did not control “non-banks” directly, but changed rules & purchases (e.g., MBS).

A recession is A period during which aggregate output (GDP) declines for at least two quarters.

Financial systems and security markets have regulations in order to:

- Prevent loss of confidence and contagion.
- Promote safety and soundness of financial firms.
- Protect consumers who may be poorly informed.

Which of the following actions taken by a central bank is expansionary? Purchases of government bonds

Which action is a Central Bank most likely to engage in: Lender of last resort.

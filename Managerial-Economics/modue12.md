## LR and SR Cost

- Short run: Some inputs require some time to increase or decrease in amount. The amount of time for which they are fixed is known as the show run.
  - Example: Plant size, land, large machineries
- Long run: The amount of time required to increase or decrease the amount of all inputs is called the long run. In the long run all inputs are flexible.
  - Example: It is possible to set up more factories or buy or sell land, machineries etc. in the long run.
- In the long run, to produce any level of output, a firm will choose that mix of inputs for which its average total cost is minimum, i.e., the firm will choose the most efficient mix of inputs for any level of output.

## Economies of Scale

- The long run average total cost (ATC) curve is U-shaped because of economies of scale
- At low levels of output, with increase in output, average cost falls because of economies of scale.
- Constant returns to scale happens when average cost stays the same even as output increases
- At very high levels of production, with increase in output, average cost may actually rise because of diseconomies of scale
  - Example: Coordination problems, increase in complexities and managerial inefficiencies in larger size firms with high levels of output.

All the cost structure , the long run/short run relationships stay the same no matter which market structure we are discussing.

## Market Structure

- Profit = TR - TC
- Costs behave in similar ways for all producers and the cost curves also look similar
- TR = P X Q would depend on what price the firm charges and what level of output it decides to produce.

  - So, how does a firm decide what price to charge and what level of output to produce?

    - Depends on the market structure in which the firm operates.

- Demand, Prices and quantity produced will vary according to the structure of the market a firm is operating in.
- Variations in market structure basically arises due to certain characteristics of the product that the firm is selling.
- Broadly, market structures differ from each other ont he basis of the following:
  - Number of sellers
  - Substitutability of the product
  - Ease of entry and exit from the market
  - Market power of individual seller

### Perfect Competition

- There are many buyers and sellers in the market
- The products are homogeneous and there is perfect information
- Firms can easily enter or exit the market
- Buyers and sellers are all "price takers", i.e., they take the market price as given and no individual buyer or seller has any influence on the market price,
- eg. milk, eggs

#### Understanding the Revenue for a competitive firm

- Total Revenue: TR = P X Q
- Average Revenue: AR = TR / Q = P
- Marginal Revenue: MR = d TR / d Q
  - MR = P is true for only competitive firms.
- Maximize Pi = TR - TC

      d Pi / d Q = 0 => d TR / d Q - d TC / d Q = 0
      or MR - MC = 0

  Firm chooses the level of output Q\* that fulfills the condition of MR = MC

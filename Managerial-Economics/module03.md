# The Firm

In the module on The Firm we will discuss types of firms, production functions, firm revenue and costs (fixed, variable, total; average; marginal), and profit maximization. This material provides a foundation on which you will build in all other functional areas: accounting, finance, marketing, etc.

By the end of this module you should be able to

- Use the concept of opportunity cost - the next best alternative - for economic decision-making.
- Maximize firm profit, where profit = total revenue - total cost, and identify how changes in the firm's business environment affect its profit.

Construct

- Firm revenue (total revenue, average revenue and marginal revenue)
- Firm cost structures (total cost, fixed cost, variable cost and average cost and marginal cost).

## Objectives of the Firm

**Profit**: Total Revenue (TR) minus Total Cost (TC)

Π = TR - TC

In a competitive market _**Π = 0**_. If the profit were positive, then other firms will enter.

## Analysis of revenue, costs & profits

- **Total revenue** (_TR_): total receipts from the sale of a good or service

  Total revenue = Price × Quantity

- **Average revenue** (_AR_): average of revenue per unit sold

  Average revenue = TR/Q

- **Marginal revenue** (_MR_): revenue on the next unit sold

  Marginal revenue = ΔTR/ΔQ

### Production Function

- **Factors of production**: inputs to the production of goods or services, including land, labor, capital, and materials.

- **Production function**: relationship between the quantity produced and the factors of production: capital (K) and labor (L)

  Q = f(K,L)

### Costs of Production

- **Total cost** (_TC_): sum of all costs of producing goods or services
- **Total fixed cost** (_TFC_): sum of all costs that do not change with the level of production
  - **quasi-fixed cost**: cost that is fixed for a specific range of production but that changes at other levels of production
- **Total variable cost** (_TVC_): sum of all costs that change with the level of production
- **Average fixed cost** (_AFC_): total fixed cost divided by quantity produced
- **Average variable cost** (_AVC_): total variable cost divided by quantity produced
- **Average total cost** (_ATC_): total cost divided by quantity produced
- **Marginal cost** (_MC_): change in total cost for 1 more unit produced
- **Opportunity Cost**: value of the next best alternative (returns of a possible option – returns of a chosen option)

The math is simple (e.g., Total cost = Total variable cost + Total fixed cost, or TC = TFC + TVC). The importance of these concepts is in the understanding of the supply curve and, eventually, profit maximization by the firm.

Profit is maximized when P = MC, at a point where MC is increasing.

## Breakeven & Shutdown

- **Breakeven point**: quantity produced at which all costs are covered

  - Perfect competition: breakeven is the quantity of production at which the price, average revenue, and marginal revenue are equal to average total cost.
  - Quantity at which TR = TC.
  - For a firm in a competitive market, the price is always equal to: marginal revenue. Therefore, in perfectly competitive markets, MR = MC also means that P = MC.

- **Shutdown point**: quantity produced at which the average revenue is less than the average variable cost.
  - Quantity at which AR < AVC.
  - At shutdown: firm must pay fixed costs but stops production because it cannot cover variable costs.

| Revenue-Cost Relationship   | Short-Run Decision           | Long-Term Decision |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| TR ⩾ TC                     | Stay in market               | Stay in market     |
| TR > TVC but TR < TFC + TVC | Stay in market               | Exit market        |
| TR < TVC                    | Shut down production to zero | Exit market        |

## Economies and Diseconomies of Scale

- **Economies of scale**: changes in cost structures that occur when a firm changes its size (or scale). Average costs are usually U-shaped:
  - They fall as fixed costs are spread over more units
  - Reach a minimum
  - Eventually begin to rise again (due to input shortages, etc.)
- Operating at the least cost (**minimum efficient scale**, MES) is important for the long-term survival of a firm

Economies of scale result from many factors, but the effect is lower costs of production. Diseconomies of scale, where marginal costs increase, may occur at some point.

Examples of economics of scale: distribution system (e.g., Wal-Mart), shipping (e.g., large ships)

## Profit Maximization: Short & Long run

- Short run: Without economies of scale, the firm earns zero profit.
- Long run: The firm is able to exploit economies of scale and earn a positive profit. If:
  - Perfectly competitive market: Competitors will enter and profit is driven to zero.
  - Imperfectly competitive market: Firm can earn profit if competitors do not enter the market. We will discuss imperfect competition later.

What will happen to the number of firms in the market and the price of this good when this industry returns to long-run equilibrium?

- the number of firms decreases; price increases

- When firms are losing money, some of those firms will exit the industry in the long run. This decreases supply in the market, which increases price.

## Productivity

**Productivity**: average output per unit of input

- Labor productivity: easily identified and measured
- Unit of input for labor = L

- Increasing productivity increases profitability
  - increased rewards to workers may increase productivity
- Measures:
  - **Total product** (_TP_), or output (_Q_): sum of production in #units produced.
  - **Average product** (_AP_): total product divided by #units input, TP/L
  - **Marginal product** (_MP_): productivity of the next unit produced (change in TP if one more unit of input added), ΔTP/ΔL

Example: Productivity of Labor

| Labor | Total Product | Marginal Product | Average Product |
| ----- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 0     | 0             | --               | --              |
| 1     | 10            | 10-0/1-0 = 10    | 10/1 = 10.0     |
| 2     | 19            | 19-10/2-1 = 9    | 19/2 = 9.5      |
| 3     | 27            | 27-19/3-2 = 8    | 27/3 = 9.0      |
| 4     | 34            | 34-27/4-3 = 7    | 34/4 = 8.5      |

## Summary

- Under perfect competition, profit is zero.
- Profit maximization occurs at Q\* where the difference between TR & TC is greatest
- In the long run, all firm inputs are variable, which expands profit potential & cost structures available to the firm.
- Firm shuts down in short run if TR does not cover variable cost in full.
- Production function: defines relationship between TP and inputs. AP and MP measure firm productivity.
- Increases in productivity reduce business costs & increase profit.

If shark repellent is produced in a perfectly competitive market and its long-run supply curve is horizontal, which of the following must be true?

- When more firms enter this market, input prices don’t change.
- A horizontal curve is perfectly elastic, and a perfectly elastic long-run supply curve indicates a constant cost industry. When more firms enter a constant-cost industry, input prices aren't affected.

Which of the following happens in the long run when demand increases in a perfectly competitive constant cost industry?

- Price doesn’t change.
- There is no long-run effect of a change in demand on the market price in a perfectly competitive constant cost industry. This is why the long-run supply curve in this kind of industry is perfectly elastic.
- In the short run, firm's make economic profits. But in the long run, firms in perfectly competitive markets earn zero economic profits.
- Perfectly competitive firms are always allocatively efficient.
- Market quantity increases in the long run when demand increases.

Washi tape is produced in a perfectly competitive market. If the long-run supply curve for washi tape is upward sloping, which of the following is true?

- The long-run supply curve is downward sloping for an decreasing cost industry, not upward sloping.
- The long-run supply curve is upward sloping for increasing cost industries.

Typical firms in a perfectly competitive decreasing cost industry are currently earning economic profits.
What will happen to the number of firms, the market price, and each firm's marginal cost in the long run?

- Firms enter the market when firms earn economic profits, not exit the market. Also, market price and marginal cost only increase in the long run for an increasing cost industry, not a decreasing cost industry.
- The number of firms will increase; the market price will decrease; marginal cost will decrease.
  When firms earn economic profits, this attracts more firms to this industry. If an industry is a decreasing cost industry, the entry of new firms drives costs down. As a result, the market price decreases in the long run.

Allocative efficiency occurs when a firm produces the quantity where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, and firms in perfectly competitive markets are always allocatively efficient. When perfectly competitive firms produce at the lowest possible cost per unit, which is sometimes called productive efficiency, they are earning zero economic profits and no other firms have an incentive to enter or exit this market, which occurs in long-run equilibrium.

Allocative efficiency occurs when a firm produces the quantity where marginal benefit (MB) equals marginal cost (MC). A perfectly competitive firm always produces the allocatively efficient quantity because the good's price reflects its marginal benefit, and a perfectly competitive firm always produces where P=MR=MC. Productive efficiency occurs when a firm produces the quantity where average total cost is minimized, and a perfectly competitive firm produces this quantity in the long run.

Allocative efficiency occurs when a firm produces the quantity where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, and firms in perfectly competitive markets are always allocatively efficient. When perfectly competitive firms produce at the lowest possible cost per unit, which is sometimes called productive efficiency, they are earning zero economic profits and no other firms have an incentive to enter or exit this market, which occurs in long-run equilibrium.

The market supply shifts right if firms enter the market. However, if typical firms in a perfectly competitive market are both allocatively and productively efficient, there is no incentive for other firms to enter this market. If firms are productively efficient, increasing or decreasing output will increase their average total costs.

Meliah's Maps produces road maps in a perfectly competitive market. What is true about the quantity of maps this firm produces in the long run?

- Marginal benefit equals marginal cost and the average total cost is minimized.
- A perfectly competitive firm is both allocatively efficient and productively efficient in the long run. A firm is allocatively efficient if it produces the quantity where marginal benefit equals marginal cost, and it is productively efficient if it produces the quantity where average total cost is minimized.

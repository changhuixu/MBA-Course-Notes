# Trade and Globalization

In this module we will discuss international trade. The U.S. is a large open economy with significant trade in final goods and services and inputs to the production process. The U.S. currently has a trade deficit and is a net debtor nation. We will see that theses two facts are linked.

By the end of this module you should be able to

- Assess the gains from trade.
- Identify the difference between absolute versus comparative advantage, and the fact that a country can benefit from trade even if does not have an absolute advantage in any good or service.
- Identify how countries will specialize based on their comparative advantage.
- Assess why trade is often controversial (the gains are diffuse, but the costs are usually concentrated).
- Derive the link between trade in goods and services and financial flows.
- Assess why trade wars are destructive.

## What Is Globalization?

And How Has the Global Economy Shaped the United States?

In this guide, **globalization** refers to international trade and some of the investment flows among advanced economies, mostly focusing on the United States.

The wide-ranging effects of globalization are complex and politically charged. As with major technological advances, globalization benefits society as a whole, while harming certain groups. Understanding the relative costs and benefits can pave the way for alleviating problems while sustaining the wider payoffs.

### THE HISTORY OF GLOBALIZATION IS DRIVEN BY TECHNOLOGY, TRANSPORTATION, AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

### GLOBALIZATION AS A TOOL FOR PROSPERITY AND PEACE

After World War II, the United States helped build a global economic order governed by mutually accepted rules and overseen by multilateral institutions. The idea was to create a better world with countries seeking to cooperate with one another to promote prosperity and peace. Free trade and the rule of law were mainstays of the system, helping to prevent most economic disputes from escalating into larger conflicts. The institutions established include:

- IMF: International Monetary Fund
- UN: United Nations
- World Bank
- WTO: World Trade Organization
- NATO: North Atlantic Treaty Organization

### EFFECTS OF GLOBALIZATION

- MORE GOODS AT LOWER PRICES

  Globalization encourages each country to specialize in what it produces best using the least amount of resources, known as **comparative advantage**. This concept makes production more efficient, promotes economic growth, and lowers prices of goods and services, making them more affordable especially for lower-income households.

- SCALED UP BUSINESSES

  Larger markets enable companies to reach more customers and get a higher return on the fixed costs of doing business, like building factories or conducting research. Technology firms have taken special advantage of their innovations this way.

- BETTER QUALITY AND VARIETY

  Competition from abroad drives US firms to improve their products. Consumers have better products and more choices as a result.

- INNOVATION

  Expanded trade spurs the spread of technology, innovation, and the communication of ideas. The best ideas from market leaders spread more easily.

- JOB CHURN

  Globalization supports new job opportunities but also contributes to job displacement. It does not significantly change the total number of positions in the economy, as job numbers are primarily driven by business cycles and Federal Reserve and fiscal policies. Nevertheless, a Peterson Institute study finds 156,250 US jobs were lost on net each year between 2001 and 2016 from expanded trade in manufactured goods, which represents less than 1 percent of the workers laid off in a typical year. Low-wage workers in certain regions are most affected. Many of them also face lower earnings or have dropped out of the workforce. Bigger factors than trade driving job displacements are labor-saving technologies, like automated machines and artificial intelligence. Better-paying positions have opened up in manufactured exports—especially in high-tech areas, such as computers, chemicals, and transportation equipment—and other high-skill work, notably in business services, such as finance and real estate (see Jobs section).

- DECLINE IN GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR GLOBALLY, BUT WIDER INEQUALITY WITHIN UNITED STATES

  Globalization has helped narrow inequality between the poorest and richest people in the world, with the number living in extreme poverty cut by half since 1990. But within many countries, including the United States, inequality is rising. A consensus of scholarly work holds that globalization has contributed marginally to rising US wage inequality, putting this factor at 10 to 20 percent. A leading explanation for rising US inequality is that technology is reducing demand for certain low- and middle-wage workers and increasing demand for high-skilled, higher-paid workers. Wages have also stagnated, though economists are still debating the exact causes. Countries exposed to globalization have alleviated inequality to different degrees through tax and welfare systems. The United States has done the least among advanced economies to mobilize government policies to reduce inequality.

### GLOBALIZATION HAS DISPLACED SOME WORKERS, WHILE SUPPORTING HIGH-SKILL JOBS

Globalization changes the types of jobs available but has little effect on the overall number of jobs in the ever-changing US labor market. That being said, some workers have directly benefited from expanding global commerce, while others have not.

Globalization has also diminished US worker bargaining leverage to demand higher wages.

Demand will likely increase for more highly-skilled manufacturing workers, in areas such as engineering, management, finance, computer and mathematical occupations, and sales.

### WHY SUPPORT GLOBALIZATION IF IT DISPLACES JOBS?

Economists look at the effects of globalization across the entire economy to weigh the pros vs. cons. Since the overall payoff is so much greater than the costs to individual workers or groups who have lost out, nearly all economists support having an open global market versus closing it off.

Globalization is like technological progress.

Protectionism helps select groups but at a higher cost for everyone else.

Operating within a rules-based system allows for peaceful conflict resolution.

### THE PUBLIC HAS MIXED VIEWS ON GLOBALIZATION

Globalization can be a hard sell to the public because the benefits are widely distributed and not as easily understood, compared with the personal costs to very specific companies or workers.

### SUSTAINING GLOBALIZATION THROUGH POLICY ACTION

The global economy has yielded enormous economic gains for the United States, but problems undoubtedly remain. There are abuses within the system and rules need to be updated. Trade agreements should account for the modern digital age.

But trade negotiations can only go so far. Not enough has been done to help those who have lost out from trade competition. And the reality is that the problems people face today go far beyond the effects of globalization.

### GLOSSARY

**Goods** are physical, produced items traded between countries, like corn, machinery parts, or chemicals.

**Services** are business activities conducted between countries, such as tourism, finance, insurance, real estate, science exchanges, professional services, business management, education, health care, arts, entertainment, accommodation, and food services.

**Exports** are goods and services that are sold to individuals or companies outside of their country of origin.

**Imports** are goods or services purchased from outside the country.

A **trade deficit** occurs when spending on imports exceeds what is earned from selling exports. A **trade surplus** is the opposite, when earnings from exports top spending on imports. A country's **trade balance**, either a surplus or deficit, is not affected by tariffs or trade agreements but by larger economic factors, like government spending and monetary policy.

**Protectionism** is the term for government restrictions on international trade aimed at blocking foreign products and driving companies and consumers to purchase domestically produced goods and services. The government may enact taxes on imports (called **tariffs**), limits on the quantity of imports (called **quotas**), subsidies to domestic industries, or other regulations. Tariffs are paid by domestic importers, not foreign governments or exporters.

**Trade liberalization** is the opposite of protectionism—when countries allow people and businesses to buy and sell across borders with fewer restrictions. In this context, liberal refers to more free or open trade.

## Gains from Trade

Claim: In general, there are real gains from trade.

### Key Concepts:

- A country has an _**absolute advantage**_ in the production of a good relative to another country if it can produce the good <u>at lower cost</u> _or_ <u>with higher productivity</u>. Absolute advantage compares industry productivities across countries.

- A country has a _**comparative advantage**_ in the production of a good if it can produce that good at a lower <u>opportunity cost</u> relative to another country. Opportunity cost is defined as the value of the next best opportunity.

## Trade and Trade Wars

### Trade surpluses & deficits

    NX = X - M = Y - (C + I + G)

- Trade Surplus:

  output > spending and exports > imports

  Size of the trade surplus = NX

- Trade Deficit:

  spending > output and imports > exports

  Size of the trade deficit = -NX

### International Capital Flows

- Net capital outflow

  = S - I = net outflow of funds
  = net purchases of foreign assets

  S: domestic saving; I: domestic investment

- When S > I, country is a net lender

- When S < I, country is a net borrower

Link between Trade & Capital Flows

    NX = Y - (C + I + G) = S - I

Thus a country with a trade deficit (NX < 0) is a net borrower (S < I).

### Trade Wars

- Economic damage: lower GDP, higher prices; contributed to the Great Depression & market crash.
- Political damage.

## Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)

In business analysis, the **production possibility frontier** (_PPF_) is a curve that illustrates the variations in the amounts that can be produced of two products if both depend upon the same finite resource for their manufacture.

PPF also plays a crucial role in economics. It can be used to demonstrate the point that any nation's economy reaches its greatest level of efficiency when it produces only what it is best qualified to produce and trades with other nations for the rest of what it needs.

The PPF is also referred to as the production possibility curve or the transformation curve.

### Understanding the PPF

In macroeconomics, the PPF is the point at which a country's economy is most efficiently producing its various goods and services and, therefore, allocating its resources in the best way possible.

- The PPF demonstrates that the production of one commodity may increase only if the production of the other commodity decreases.
- The PPF is a decision-making tool for managers deciding on the optimum product mix for the company.
- If the economy is producing more or less of the quantities indicated by the PPF, resources are being managed inefficiently and the nation's economic stability will deteriorate.

### Trade, Comparative Advantage, and Absolute Advantage

An economy may be able to produce for itself all of the goods and services it needs to function using the PPF as a guide. However, this may actually lead to an overall inefficient allocation of resources and hinder future growth when the benefits of trade are considered.

Through specialization, a country can concentrate on the production of just a few things that it can do best, rather than trying to do everything on its own.

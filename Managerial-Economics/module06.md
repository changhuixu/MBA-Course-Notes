# International Macroeconomic Environment of the Firm

In this module we will study the Financial Crisis and the Great Recession. The movie "Panic: The Untold Story of the 2008 Financial Crisis" is documentary film that provides an overview of the Financial Crisis, through a series of interviews with Ben Bernake (FED Chair), Hank Paulson (Treasury Secretary) and Tim Geithner (NY FED President). The crisis is interesting in its own right, and it also illustrates the use of monetary policy, both conventional and unconventional, as well as the interaction between monetary policy and fiscal policy. We will also discuss the mechanics of Quantitative Easing (QE).

By the end of this module you should be able to

- Assess the causes of and policy responses to the 2008 Financial Crisis.
- Identify the use of conventional and unconventional (QE) monetary policy
- Assess the effectiveness, risks and limits of monetary policy.

## Quantitative Easing: QE

Traditional FED tools: Open market operations, reserve requirement, policy interest rate. QE is a relatively new tool.

- Central Banks (CB): Usually try to stimulate the economy by cutting the interest rate R.

- QE: When interest rates hit the zero lower bound (ZLB) the CB buys assets, usually govt bonds. Private banks sell the bonds and get money:
  - Boosts the money base
  - Should stimulate the economy (lending)

### FED Funds Rate & ZLB

- Fed Funds rate: Interest rate banks charge each other to use FED funds
- Controlled by the FED (indirectly) by buying & selling Treasury bonds to banks
- The ZLB became a constraint in Dec 2008

US asset bubble collapse

- US housing bubble collapse in 2006
- FED Response: 3 rounds of QE

## POLICY RESPONSES TO A CRISIS

1. Conventional MP: FED increases M to lower R and encourage spending (hit the ZLB)
1. Conventional FP: Govt increases Spending & cuts Taxes
1. Lender of Last Resort: FED did this to NBFI
1. Unconventional Policy:
   - QE: FED bought MBS
   - Injections of govt funds: TARP, AIG

## Risks of QE

- Interest Rate (R) falls:
  - Good for borrowers
  - Bad for savers & pension funds (many in deficit)
- Inflation: none so far
- New bubbles from low R (elsewhere)
- Currency problems
  - Dollar collapse: no
  - Other currencies become stronger

## How Quantitative Easing Works

- Step 1. The Federal Reserve buys mortgage securities and Treasurys from the banks and securities dealders through the trading arm of the New York Fed.
- Step 2. This removes these safer investments from the markets and pushes down yields on these investments.
- Step 3. Investors turn to other assets like stocks, corporate bonds and even commodities, pushing their prices higher.

**The goal**

Lowered rates on bonds will keep mortgage and other consumer rates low and encourage investors to buy assets with higher returns and more risk, such as stocks and corporate bonds.

**The risks**

Critics argue Fed money printing could cause a dollar collapse and spur inflation later, and doubt it will feed through to the broader economy.

## Summary of Future Issues

- QE was necessary. The global financial system was close to a meltdown in 2008.
- Corona Bonds?
- Risks associated with the program:
  - Inflation: need not occur if M is withdrawn properly.
  - State/Sovereign default?
  - New asset price bubbles from the flood of liquidity in search of investment opportunities (as in the 80s).
